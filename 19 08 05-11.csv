5000g000028bdDqAAI,Subscription - Refund,"To whom it may concern   I, last evening was reading a Christian Science Monitor article that Tony Lobl had posted on Facebook. Later I noticed a debit from my account of R 1719.22; I may have (because I can’t remember) accidentally hit the subscribe button. The subscribe button is on the bottom right hand page as you read and I do use my right thumb to scroll up, usually in a hurried fashion. Previously I had a subscription. But I discontinued it.  I cannot afford this debit and I seek to see if you offer assistance in having this debit returned.  I have contacted my bank and they have confirmed the debit. There is a form I will complete to have the matter investigated, but I’m hoping that your help will be quicker.

5000g000028b7hzAAA,Supreme Court Gives Life to Christian Funeral Home Case,"Click here to view or share the web version.  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  August 6, 2019  Contact:  Craig Parshall, General Counsel  202-543-0073  [1]cparshall@nrb.org  Supreme Court Gives Life to Christian Funeral Home Case  WASHINGTON (NRB) – Yesterday the Supreme Court decided to take up a case involving a Christian funeral home’s objection to a key employee’s decision to “transition” to a different sex. It brings us one step closer to a definitive ruling on the future rights of faith-based businesses and ministries, according to National Religious Broadcasters (NRB), America’s preeminent association of Christian broadcasters and communicators.  A lower court had ordered the faith-based funeral service – which has the mission statement “to honor God in all that we do” – to allow its male director to dress and present himself at work as a woman.  “While the issue that the Supreme Court took up is a narrow one, whether civil rights protections against ‘sex’ discrimination passed in 1964 should include ‘gender identity’ and transgender rights, it will have vast implications for religious groups,” says Craig Parshall, General Counsel for NRB. “There is an increasing movement to force faith-based employers to bend to the newly-minted doctrine that a person’s subjective ideas of how they think of their own gender should always prevail, regardless of the religious conscience of employers, businesses, and ministries.”  The case is R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Home, Inc. v. Equal Opportunity Employment Commission. The funeral home is represented by NRB member organization Alliance Defending Freedom.  About NRB  The National Religious Broadcasters (NRB) is a nonpartisan, international association of Christian communicators whose member organizations represent millions of listeners, viewers, and readers. Our mission is to advance biblical truth, promote media excellence, and defend free speech. In addition to promoting standards of excellence, integrity, and accountability, NRB provides networking, educational, ministry, and fellowship opportunities for its members. This year, NRB marks its 75th anniversary as an association.

5000g000028asu8AAA,POLITICO Massachusetts Playbook: TRAHAN can’t shake KOH — Mass shootings hit home — WHAT TO KNOW about the RMV,"Aug 05, 2019 View in browser                     By Stephanie Murray         GOOD MORNING, MASSACHUSETTS. It's good to be back! I'm on my way to Nashville for the National Conference of State Legislatures 2019 Legislative Summit. Drop me a line if you're there: smurray@politico.com.  IS DAN KOH AROUND THE CORNER? - Rep. Lori Trahan can't seem to shake Dan Koh. Her former rival for the 3rd District nomination recently broke his silence after a tense recount during the 2018 primary, and now Trahan seems to be looking over her shoulder for a challenge next year.   Tension between Trahan and Koh has been brewing for a few weeks. The morning of former special counsel Robert Mueller's hearing before congress, Koh called for Trahan to support impeaching President Donald Trump via an op-ed in The Lowell Sun. Trahan had previously said lawmakers should hear from Mueller before making a call on impeachment. When Trahan called for Trump's impeachment after hearing Mueller testify, it looked as though Koh forced her hand.  Trahan dispelled that notion when she was asked whether Koh, now an Andover selectmen, played a role in her decision, during an appearance on Keller @ Large that aired Sunday morning.  ""No more than all of the other constituents who called my office expressing their concern,"" Trahan said. ""It wasn't a change of mind. We always had impeachment on the table, and I think as the administration continued to obstruct the investigative and the oversight hearings, not complying with the subpoenas, that was moving us in that direction.""  But while Trahan brushed off Koh's criticism on television, she's taking him seriously and gearing up for a potential challenge. Trahan sent a fundraising email to supporters last week saying it's ""pretty clear"" a former opponent is running against her. To be fair, there aren't many other town selectmen publicly calling for the president's impeachment.  ""It's never lost on me that I have to put myself in a position where I need to re-apply for this job and make my case to voters every two years,"" Trahan wrote last week. ""In fact, I was reminded of this when one former primary opponent made it pretty clear last week that he is running against me.""   For his part, Koh has said it's too early to tell whether he'll run against Trahan in a primary in 2020. But Trahan only beat Koh by around 150 votes in a crowded election last cycle, and her campaign is under scrutiny for a campaign finance issue, which could take a year, or even longer, for the FEC to resolve. Trahan's campaign has previously called that complaint, filed by a Washington-based watchdog group, ""completely without merit.""   As it stands, Trahan is one of the few members of the delegation who don't have a primary challenger in Massachusetts. Sen. Ed Markey and Reps. Richie Neal, Stephen Lynch, Joe Kennedy III and Seth Moulton all have primaries. That's a departure for a state that used to be criticized for its lack of electoral action - and it's only August.

Wade, Eagle-Tribune: ""Gov. Charlie Baker has wielded his veto pen every year since taking office in 2015, in part, to fulfill his campaign pledges to reduce government spending and weed earmarks from the state budget. But this week, in an unprecedented move, the second-term Republican governor signed a $43.3 billion budget bloated with tens of millions of dollars worth of earmarks - without vetoing any spending measures. Lawmakers padded the budget with funding for pet projects and programs in their districts during protracted deliberations, which helped drive up the cost of the final spending plan by $600 million.""  - ""RMV scandal: What we know about the failures within the registry before New Hampshire crash that killed 7,"" by Steph Solis, MassLive.com: ""The horrific crash in New Hampshire that left seven motorcyclists dead and families heartbroken had a ripple effect across state lines into Massachusetts and grew into a scandal over failures at the Registry of Motor Vehicles. Authorities in Massachusetts wanted to know how and why 23-year-old West Springfield resident Volodymyr Zhukovskyy, the man accused of killing the motorcycle riders, was still behind the wheel. Zhukovskyy had a driving under the influence arrest one month prior in Connecticut. His license was never suspended on that charge. RMV  officials said his out-of-state violation was one of thousands left unprocessed.""  - ""Justice reinvestment gets seed funding in budget,"" by Ben Forman, CommonWealth Magazine: ""AS MASSACHUSETTS IMPLEMENTS last year's sweeping criminal justice reform package, we must stay focused on justice reinvestment-the effort to squeeze more public safety from limited resources by reducing prison terms and redirecting the savings to behavioral health treatment, education, training, and reentry services. The state budget signed last week by Gov. Charlie Baker includes promising new provisions suggesting that state leaders are treating the 2018 bill as a solid foundation for additional reforms, not the last word on the issue.""  - ""Sorry diners: No state tax holiday for restaurants,"" The Associated Press: ""If you plan on dining out during the state's sales tax holiday later this month, you'll still have to pay the 6.25 percent Massachusetts meals tax. That's no different from the way it's worked during prior tax holidays, but for a time it wasn't clear if restaurants might be included during the two-day hiatus consumers enjoy from paying sales taxes. A 2018 law establishing the tax holiday as a permanent annual fixture did not, as written, specifically exempt meals purchased at restaurants, as had been the case when it was decided year-to-year whether to hold the holiday. Republican Gov. Charlie Baker asked the  Legislature to restore the meals exemption, which lawmakers did on Wednesday.""  - ""BAKER VETOES JANUS BILL OVER CELLPHONE PRIVACY CONCERNS,"" by Matt Murphy, State House News Service: ""Gov. Charlie Baker vetoed a bill Friday that would allow unions to charge non-union employees fees for representing them in certain labor disputes, challenging the House and Senate to override him in order to restore a key source of funding for public sector unions. Baker supports allowing unions to charge non-members for representation in grievance and arbitration hearings, though not collective bargaining, but said the bill goes too far to invade the privacy of workers who opt against joining a union.""         FROM THE HUB       - ""In wake of shootings, fears that 'it is not safe to be Latino,'"" by John Hilliard and Gal Tziperman Lotan, Boston Globe: ""As hundreds of parishioners were gathering for Mass Sunday at Most Holy Redeemer Catholic Church in East Boston, many dressed in blue and white to honor El Salvador's patron saint, the Rev. Americo Santos said he worries for their safety. Santos grappled with how to protect them, he said, should similar violence strike close to home. ""We don't know in this church if someone will appear,"" Santos said in an interview before Mass. ""We trust that Jesus will protect us."" During the Mass, they prayed for the victims of the weekend's two mass shootings in El Paso and in  Dayton, Ohio, that claimed a total of 29 lives. Authorities believe the Texas suspect published a manifesto before the shooting that targeted Hispanic immigrants. Investigators did not give a motive in the Ohio murders.""  - ""Unwatched, a sober home business boomed. Then they found the bones,"" by Evan Allen, Boston Globe: ""Sober homes are in the business of housing some of society's most fragile people as they navigate the delicate stages of early recovery. But no one is watching. Anyone can open a sober home - just hang a sign on your door and start collecting rent.""  - ""T Says Damage From June Derailment Will Be Fixed By October,"" The Associated Press: ""Transit officials say it will likely be October before all repairs are completed to signals that were damaged when a Red Line train derailed in Boston. A spokesman for the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority tells The Boston Globe that the T is targeting October for having all the signals operating automatically. That's later than original timelines that had the work being completed as early as Labor Day.""  - ""Hometown advantage? Not for Boston's ad agencies,"" by Jon Chesto, Boston Globe: ""Like other chief marketing officers in the Boston area, Don Lane faces an important question: whether to buy local. Advertising, that is. As the new chief marketing officer at the Saucony shoe company in Waltham, Lane may be looking for a new ad agency later this year. ... Time was, Boston companies usually hired Boston advertising agencies. But now, if Lane stays in his backyard, he'd be bucking an industry trend. Being local is no longer an advantage for an ad agency; proximity and geography barely seem to matter anymore.""         DAY IN COURT       - ""What To Know About A Major Hearing In AG Healey's Lawsuit Against Purdue Pharma,"" by Deborah Becker, WBUR: ""A judge is weighing a motion to dismiss Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey's lawsuit against Purdue Pharma, the maker of the powerful prescription opioid drug OxyContin. At a lengthy hearing Friday in Suffolk Superior Court in Boston, both sides argued over whether the trial should go forward. Healey's suit alleges Purdue aggressively - and deceptively - marketed its opioid pain pills, even though the company knew they were addictive.""         WARREN REPORT       - ""Sanders defends Warren against Cheney over nuclear strike policy,"" by Matthew Choi, POLITICO: ""Sen. Bernie Sanders defended his 2020 Democratic presidential opponent Elizabeth Warren on Friday after Rep. Liz Cheney went after her for advocating a no-first-strike nuclear policy. During the Democratic primary debate Tuesday, Warren pushed for the United States to adopt a policy of never using a nuclear weapon unless another country uses one first - a policy CNN moderator Jake Tapper noted President Barack Obama had considered but declined. Warren said the policy would help minimize misunderstandings by foreign adversaries of U.S. intentions, preventing an accidental catastrophe.""  - ""Elizabeth Warren: Trump should not 'wink and nod and smile' about white supremacy,"" by Paul LeBlanc, CNN: ""Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren on Sunday said President Donald Trump should not ""wink and nod and smile"" about white supremacy in the wake of two mass shootings in the US in the span of 13 hours -- one massacre that involved a white supremacist suspect. ""White supremacy is a domestic terrorism threat in the same way that foreign terrorism threatens our people,"" the Massachusetts Democrat told CNN's Don Lemon on ""CNN Tonight."" 'And it is the responsibility of the President of the United States to help fight back against that. Not to wink and nod and smile at it  and let it get stronger in this country.'""         FROM THE DELEGATION       - ""Ayanna Pressley 'absolutely' believes Trump is a racist, but says her focus is policy, not rhetoric,"" by Jeremy C. Fox, Boston Globe: ""US Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley believes President Trump is a racist and has been one for decades, but the Dorchester Democrat is focused not on what the former reality TV star believes but on the very real effects of his policies in people's lives. That's what Pressley told co-hosts Ed Harding and Janet Wu on WCBV-TV's pre-recorded ""On the Record"" Sunday morning, as the three engaged in a wide-ranging interview that touched on topics from the president's attacks on ""the Squad,"" to the 2020 race, to Pressley's efforts to eliminate the federal death  penalty. ""Do you believe the president's a racist?"" Harding asked less than three minutes into the televised interview.""  - ""After Deadly Shootings, Mass. Congressional Delegation Calls For Stricter Gun Control,"" by Laney Ruckstuhl, WBUR: ""Members of Massachusetts' all-Democratic Congressional delegation are urging lawmakers to pass stricter gun control legislation after two mass shootings in less than 24 hours left at least 29 people dead. Several lawmakers tweeted in support of communities reeling from the two shootings over the weekend. A gunman in El Paso, Texas killed 20 people and injured as least 26 others on Saturday morning, officials say. A second mass shooting left at least nine people dead and 27 more injured in Dayton, Ohio early Sunday morning.""  - ""U.S. Rep. Stephen Lynch: Trump must end hateful rhetoric,"" by Andrew Martinez, Boston Herald: ""U.S. Rep Stephen Lynch on Sunday said President Trump's rhetoric on illegal immigrants may ""feed a certain attitude"" in the wake of a mass shooting in El Paso, Texas, the feds are treating as a potential hate crime. Lynch, speaking in South Boston after a recent trip to the El Paso border with a congressional delegation, said the president's demonization of illegal immigrants, including calling them ""rapists and murderers"" has not been helpful.""         KENNEDY COMPOUND       - ""Saoirse Kennedy Hill funeral set for Monday morning,"" by Jeremy C. Fox, Boston Globe: ""Saoirse Kennedy Hill, the 22-year-old granddaughter of the late Robert F. Kennedy, will be remembered Monday morning in a funeral Mass on Cape Cod, according to a family spokesman. Kennedy Hill, a Boston College student, was found unresponsive at the Kennedy compound in Hyannis Port on Thursday afternoon and later pronounced dead at Cape Cod Hospital. Her funeral Mass will take place at 11 a.m. at Our Lady of Victory Church in the Barnstable village of Centerville, according to a statement released Sunday by Brian Wright O'Connor, a spokesman for former congressman Joseph P. Kennedy II. A private  burial service will follow the Mass.""         MARIJUANA IN MASSACHUSETTS       - ""Commissioner abstains on most pot license votes,"" by Jack Sullivan, CommonWealth Magazine: ""THE MOST IMPORTANT ROLE for the state's five-member Cannabis Control Commission is, arguably, its mandate to vote on granting recreational marijuana licenses, without which there can be no growing, manufacturing, or, most importantly, sales. But Commissioner Shaleen Title has not cast a vote on the vast majority of final licenses issued by the board, the last procedural step before a recreational facility can begin operations. Title, who has been vocal in her criticism of host community agreements she claims violate the adult use law which she helped draw up, has abstained or recused herself from  nearly 80 percent of the 77 roll calls the commission has taken on issuing final licenses.""         ABOVE THE FOLD       - Herald: ""AMERICA MOURNS"" - Globe: ""THIS IS WHAT WE'VE BECOME.""         FROM THE 413       - ""The Trans-Commonwealth RR: Newton Service So Close... & yet So Far Away,"" by Matt Szafranski, Western Mass Politics & Insight: ""The same highway and rail line that divide Boston also splits Newton. In the capital city, the corridor separates neighborhoods from each other. Here, it pierces several of this city's villages. Frothing traffic spills out into veins of streets, branching outward from the Turnpike. The Worcester Line tracks and dismal stations along I-90 provide little relief. Substandard commuter rail bleeds into housing, environmental, accessibility and quality of life. Advocates have demanded upgrades for years and municipal candidates have begun to take heed. Yet, this  length of track is only part of the larger ex-Boston & Albany Railroad. Investment is in demand throughout its length. If realized, it could transform Massachusetts, but perhaps only if the route is considered a coherent whole.""              Artificial intelligence. Facial recognition. Lightning fast networks.

5000g000028b7hpAAA,Supreme Court Gives Life to Christian Funeral Home Case,"Click here to view or share the web version.  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  August 6, 2019  Contact:  Craig Parshall, General Counsel  202-543-0073  [1]cparshall@nrb.org  Supreme Court Gives Life to Christian Funeral Home Case  WASHINGTON (NRB) – Yesterday the Supreme Court decided to take up a case involving a Christian funeral home’s objection to a key employee’s decision to “transition” to a different sex. It brings us one step closer to a definitive ruling on the future rights of faith-based businesses and ministries, according to National Religious Broadcasters (NRB), America’s preeminent association of Christian broadcasters and communicators.  A lower court had ordered the faith-based funeral service – which has the mission statement “to honor God in all that we do” – to allow its male director to dress and present himself at work as a woman.  “While the issue that the Supreme Court took up is a narrow one, whether civil rights protections against ‘sex’ discrimination passed in 1964 should include ‘gender identity’ and transgender rights, it will have vast implications for religious groups,” says Craig Parshall, General Counsel for NRB. “There is an increasing movement to force faith-based employers to bend to the newly-minted doctrine that a person’s subjective ideas of how they think of their own gender should always prevail, regardless of the religious conscience of employers, businesses, and ministries.”  The case is R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Home, Inc. v. Equal Opportunity Employment Commission. The funeral home is represented by NRB member organization Alliance Defending Freedom.  About NRB  The National Religious Broadcasters (NRB) is a nonpartisan, international association of Christian communicators whose member organizations represent millions of listeners, viewers, and readers. Our mission is to advance biblical truth, promote media excellence, and defend free speech. In addition to promoting standards of excellence, integrity, and accountability, NRB provides networking, educational, ministry, and fellowship opportunities for its members.

That interview has gained a lot of notoriety since it was aired. Even Donald Trump, Jr. weighed in to criticize Lemon's approach.  I have to admit, I got a bit of a chuckle out of learning that I went from a ""pastor"" to a ""controversial pastor"" in the CNN display under my image - just because I didn't back off of my opinion about the president.  Now, I have been invited on Laura Ingraham's show to discuss that interview in more depth. I'll be on tonight (Monday, August 5th). So be sure to tune in to the Ingraham Angle at 10pm (EDT) on Fox News to watch!  For faith, family and freedom, Rev. Bill Owens  P.S.

The cost of living even among the cities considered the most expensive places in their state also varies widely. In the most expensive place in Alabama, a dollar goes about as far as it would in the least expensive place in California.  Methodology  To determine the most expensive city in each state, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed 2017 regional price parities among U.S. metropolitan statistical areas as calculated by the Bureau of Economic Analysis.

That's why we don't even require a contract, because we have found that our employee's provide higher quality work and are constantly searching for ways to improve knowing that clients aren't bonded to an agreement.   ** Here's what people are saying ------------------------------------------------------------ ""On behalf of Mayor Leon P. Tate, Interim City Manager (Mr. Alan E. Sims), and the City of Glenn Heights, we greatly appreciate the outstanding services provided at Heritage Community Park. The cleaning and sanitizing of the Concession Stand interior/exterior and restrooms look astonishing. All staff members were prompt, courtesy and willing to ensure Simply Pure Cleaning Services represented in a professional manner.  Thank you and much success!"" ""Daniel,  The floors look awesome! Thank you very much for doing such a great job!""  Diana Younts Midlothian Conference Center, Director ""Daniel  Thank you for going above and beyond! We have had no complaints with your business and that is incredibly refreshing!""  Hi-View ""Wow! The refrigerator looks like a new refrigerator and the floors look GREAT!""  United Methodist Church ""Simply Pure does a fantastic job! Daniel and his team are so responsive, flexible, and care about what they do.

Midlothian Methodist Church   ** We're here big or small. ------------------------------------------------------------ This church needed their small kitchen area re-done in time for an important event. They had bids prior to ours for $700+, but we strive to offer unbeatable deals to churches in our community! We completed these floors for only $290.00, that's right, we deep cleaned, buffed, waxed and finished this job in 8 hours and still came in at the most reasonable price!   ** If you're wondering how.. ------------------------------------------------------------ It's because we do not add prices to our services. We simply charge for the amount of footage and products needed. We do not over charge for wax/ stripping solutions and do NOT charge for the use of our machines like most companies. We also do not charge extra if we decide to assign more employee's to get the job done faster.     ** Climbing mountains for our potential partners! ------------------------------------------------------------  During the month of August we will be offering FREE trial cleanings for anyone in DFW and Ellis County.

But did you know probiotics are also helpful in maintaining optimal vaginal health? Probiotics can help maintain a healthy pH balance when it comes to the vagina and prevent everything from odor to infections to general unpleasantness down below. And for frequent yeast or bacterial infection sufferers, they can offer a whole lot of relief.

We are no longer as apt to look for Him in superstition, dogma, and theological formulations, as we are in our own honest, persuasive, spiritual experiences.

That the dissatisfaction in the world with the concept of a disciplinary Father God is what we are losing faith in....an outmoded view of God, not God himself.

5000g000028b435AAA,What does Beowulf have to do with Brexit?,"Good Morning Stephanie,  I am writing about Epic Continent: Adventures in the Great Stories of Europe (ISBN: 978-1529374346, Nicholas Brealey/Hachette, August 27, 2019), by award-winning travel writer Nicholas Jubber. In the book Jubber travels from Turkey to Iceland on a fascinating adventure through the places of Europe’s most enduring epic poems—from The Odyssey to The Song of the Nibelungen, and the Song of Roland to Beowulf—discovering the ways that the poems were shaped by their times and locations and how they have since shaped us.   In his signature warm and charming prose, Jubber explores how seemingly very different stories from very different places and times share similar themes. Issues of honor, fundamentalism, fate, nationhood, sex, class, and politics have preoccupied the people of Europe across millennia. He also notes ways that the stories written long ago are incredibly relevant when brought to bear on some of the most timely and challenging issues facing today’s Europe: Brexit, the migrant crisis and the trouble facing the European Union.  Jubber’s travel writing is well-known and much lauded—he has previously written three travel books and routinely writes for the Guardian, the Observer and the Globe and Mail. This is his first travel book that spans space, time, and celebrated literature. In a fascinating interview, he can bring his unique and insightful perspective to bear on:  · Why he chose to follow epic poems around Europe—and the unexpected places they led him along the way · How traveling today can help us understand ancient stories · How old stories like the Odyssey and Beowulf are relevant today and how they helped Europe to form into the continent it is now · The impact of historical identity on today’s European politics · And much more!  The UK version of the book has gotten incredible coverage, including being written up in the Times (https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/epic-continent-by-nicholas-jubber-review-what-has-beowulf-got-to-do-with-brexit-gc3kphfjb) , The Guardian (https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2019/jun/16/ice-fire-iceland-sagas-walking-trail-camping-trip) , and Jubber appearing on the BBC (https://www.historyextra.com/period/medieval/charlemagne-unifier-father-europe-correct-european-symbol/) .  Can I send you a review copy of Epic Continent? Would you be interested in talking with Nick Jubber? Just let me know!  Thank you for your consideration of this one!

We park, throw our luggage on a golf cart, and are piloted to our tent – a “deluxe,” $274-a-night tent with private bath. There’s a canopy-shaded porch and two chairs. We unzip the tent flaps and enter an interior designed as though Teddy Roosevelt might show up. >  > Glamping, a mashup of “glamorous” and “camping,” is a full-on thing. Google searches for it just reached 100 times their total a decade ago. There are some 35,000 glamping possibilities on Glamping Hub, a kind of Airbnb for the industry. The industry is forecast to reach $1 billion by 2024.  >  > Everyone we talk to has a theory about why it’s so popular. The practicality of not owning camping gear, the desire to escape devices, the hunger for experiences, the stress relief. And then there’s the sheer natural beauty.

That includes the bad guys. In her new mystery “Big Sky,” she explores the growing conscience of a human trafficking accomplice while still holding him accountable for his actions. As for her detective Jackson Brodie? The stoic Yorkshireman “understands his role in life is to protect the innocent,” she says. >  > What are the characteristics that make Jackson “the last good man standing”? “I understand that kind of harsh poverty that is in his background, and the tragedy as well. And so I think a lot of his background is my father’s, whereas his actual character is probably closer to mine, in a way,” she says. “I try not to use him as a mouthpiece because that would be too tempting.” >  > By Stephen Humphries > Read 4 min. > ( 1007 words ) >       > THE MONITOR'S VIEW              > Safe spaces for young men adrift (and with guns) > The 30 Sec.

It was their private activity to sent it to everyone, who wanted it. But since we got the new German bible translation, TMC didn't allow it anymore with the argument, that the bibles publisher gives no permission. But in fact the two men asked the publisher and they got the the permission to publish their reading of the bible part. It seems, all they need, is to get the permission for Science and Health to read.  Could you please help the German field? I don´t mind to pay for audio-lessons to listen during a car ride, but as long as the Publ. Soc. doesn´t offer it in German, I would love to use the private one.

Next, follow some highlights of the exclusive Noticias Telemundo interview*:  ON PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Vanessa Hauc: “Talking about what he (Trump) says and the discourse that is coming from the highest office in the country, he calls you, ""Sleepy Joe,"" what do you say to that?  Joe Biden: Well, let me tell you, Sleepy Joe is going to wake him up really quickly because none of this changes as long as he's president of the United States of America. This fomenting hate, this talk about how in fact there are good people and a whole-- and pitting us against one another based on our race, our religion, our ethnic background. That's not America. It's not who we are.”  ON THE “DEPORTER IN CHIEF”:  “Vanessa Hauc: Vice President Biden—he (Trump) has also called President Obama a Deporter in Chief. Would you be a Deporter in Chief?  Joe Biden: No. Not at all. Look, here's the deal. The day I get elected president, DREAMers are going to be legalized, number one. Number two, we have to provide a pathway to citizenship for 11 million people. Thirdly, we have to, in fact, welcome people who are seeking asylum and make a judgment about whether or not their claim is relevant and real, and not lock them up in the meantime or not keep them from even getting to the border.”  ON HIS CHOICE FOR VICE PRESIDENT:  Vanessa Hauc: Would you think about a Latino?  Joe Biden: Well, of course I would. There's no reason why that would not be the case. Look, I learned one thing about being vice president. You have to be simpatico with the president. No president can handle the job himself or herself… And they have to be able to delegate power. And when they delegate presidential power, the authority to make decisions.”  ABOUT THE EL PASO MASSACRE:  “Vanessa Hauc: As you know, our community was hit tragically in El Paso this weekend. We know the gunman was targeting immigrants, and specifically Latinos. And he used a lot of the rhetoric that the president uses. What is the responsibility of the president in these tragic events?  Joe Biden: To talk about how bad this was. The extent of the hatred that has been fomented these days. Look, the way the president talks, if he were a principal in your high school and they talked that way, the parents would be coming in saying, ""Fire him."" It's outrageous the way in which he characterizes people. He talks about animals and crossing the border. He talks about how these are people that are from rat-infested place. I mean, it's just terrible. And it's the thing that brings all the hatred out in the open. They think it's legitimate now to come out and do the things they do and talk about-- it's about white nationalism and white supremacy against minorities.”  Biden granted Telemundo this exclusive interview during the annual UnidosUS conference in San Diego, California.  *Quotes from a rush transcript/subject to change. Mandatory mention: “Noticias Telemundo exclusive.”  About Noticias Telemundo:  Noticias Telemundo is a leading news provider for U.S. Hispanics.

5000g000028awFxAAI,Child Psychiatrist with Tips to Help Kids Going Back to School,"Stephanie,     It's almost back-to-school time for kids around the country. For many students starting school for the first time or attending a new school, the transition isn't always an easy one. How can you make it easier on your kids?     Vinay Saranga M.D. is a child psychiatrist and founder of Saranga Comprehensive Psychiatry (www.sarangapsychiatry.com <http://www.sarangapsychiatry.com> )      Dr. Saranga offers these tips:     -        Ask your young kids how they are feeling: For children going to school for the first time or those starting at a new school, the transition can be difficult and filled with anxiety. Sometimes kids won't express their emotions so as parents, you need to ask them what they are feeling. Help them feel reassured and know that having mixed emotions of happiness, fear and even confusion are all normal and that many of the other kids are feeling that way too.      -        Help your kids get excited about school: Kids will model the behavior of their parents. When you talk about school, be upbeat and excited about it. Share some of the better memories you have from your school days or funny stories that portray school as a positive experience. Be real with your kids and let them know you were nervous in the beginning, but talk about all the good things like making new friends, learning to read and more.      -        Attend your school's open house: Going to your classroom a few days before school starts is about much more than just meeting your teacher. It's a chance to help eliminate the unknown for your children. When they can see the classroom, meet their classmates and see where they are spending their days, it will help reduce their anxiety on the first day because it will already be a little bit familiar.      -        Start learning before school starts: Parents should sit with their kids and encourage them to get back into reading, writing and math studies before the first day. You can even pullout some of their work from last year and review it or download learning apps to make it more fun for your kids. This helps ready the mind for learning and begins to transition your children from summer play mode to learning mode so it's not a big shock on day one.      -        Start adjusting schedules early on: Chances are, your kids probably stayed up a little later and slept in over the summer. Don't wait until the first day of school to wake them up early. Start having them go to bed a little earlier now and waking up a little earlier in the morning so it's not so difficult come the first day of school. In addition, most kids do better with structure, so map out the before and after school schedules so your kids know what to expect.        -        Get school shopping done early: Rushing around at the last minute to get all those school supplies just adds to your children's stress and anxiety. Start back-to-school shopping now. In fact, involve your kids and let them pick out their own backpacks, lunchboxes and notebooks in their favorite colors and patterns. Let them pick a new outfit for the first day of school that makes them feel confident and comfortable.      -        Find the right balance of goals for the new school year: Parents should work with their kids to set goals for the new school year. Make sure you help your kids set realistic goals that are on their learning level. Straight A's, for example, is a great goal to have, but it might be unrealistic for some kids. If the goal is too far out of reach, your child will feel overwhelmed and defeated. If it's too easy, he or she will become bored.     -        Teach your kids age appropriate realities: As your children get a little older and further along in school, they're going to have to learn some lessons about life. As parents, you can help make the transition easier for your children by sharing advice around some of these topics such as bullying and being teased, life not always being fair, the importance of sharing, saying no to drugs, learning from their failures, helping others, inclusion and equality, how to get along with difficult people, letting their voice be heard and more.       -        Give your kids something to look forward to: Like adults, children need something to look forward to. It helps keep them motivated. Plan a trip or something fun for Winter break, Spring break or next Summer. When they are feeling down, remind them that this next big great adventure is right around the corner.      Would you like to speak to Dr. Saranga? If so, I'm happy to set that up.

5000g000028b0XvAAI,Re: Rising white nationalist terror leaves its calling card,"Totally irresponsible reporting first of all the maniac in Dayton Ohio was an antifa communist who supported Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders but somehow nobody connects his ideology to his crime.Second all the people that claim that the El Paso maniac was connected to white supremacy white nationalism don't name any organizations white supremacist white nationalist etc Advocate violence! Or any leaders of these groups that Advocate violence! Because they don't! Somehow it's not supposed to bother white people the through Mass immigration of third world people much of it is illegal they are going to be made of minority in their own country surrounded by other races who hate them! And if that bothers you or if you don't think it's just they want to claim you're some kind of evil Maniac hater lusting to kill innocent people for notoriety. When in fact these killers are lone wolves representing no group at all appropriating an ideology as an excuse for their  bloodlust and Lust For notoriety it is this kind of irresponsible reporting that is fueling the violence in our land.

Today, we report on white supremacy terrorism, the Assad regime's abuse of Syrian refugees, climate change and socialism, cushy camping, and the work of novelist Kate Atkinson. But first:  As staff writer Henry Gass made his way to El Paso, Texas, last night, he received sympathetic nods when people heard he was a journalist. A woman boarding the same plane wished him good luck. The hotel attendant who checked Henry in at midnight shook his head. “I can’t believe it,” he said, adding that he finally had to change the TV channel in the deserted lobby so as not to hear any more news.This morning, Henry went to the Cielo Vista Mall and watched as people placed flowers, candles, and crosses. Agonizing questions hung in the air: What is happening? Are our communities strong? What can we do? These are among the toughest assignments for journalists. Henry also covered the 2017 shooting at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, which killed 26 people. “Part of me just really wants not to bother people,” he says. “But especially now, I want to let the rest of the country know how people here are thinking and feeling.” Those people, whom he’ll be talking to in-depth over the next couple of days, include recent and generations-old immigrants, such as the woman handing out water bottles near the mall. She tells Henry her grandmother immigrated from Mexico, “doing it right” and building a good life in a nearby neighborhood.For now, he takes heart in the signs he’s seeing: “El Paso Strong.” “Forever 915” (the city’s area code). And the small piece of cardboard on which the flags of Mexico and Texas sit side by side.       ~                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Amelia Newcomb                          Managing Editor                                                     @AmeliaNewcomb                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ANNOUNCEMENT    Have you set up your password?

In particular, both law enforcement and some Republican leaders referred to the massacre at a Walmart filled with back-to-school shoppers as “white terrorism.”“This generation of young white men don’t simply dislike the ‘other,’” says Juliette Kayyem, chair of the homeland security program at Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government. “They view America as a zero-sum game, that the other is going to replace them.”As she points out, many young white men understand that they are the last generation in the United States in which white births outnumbered those of minorities. “This sense of the ‘great replacement’ is a core feature of what explains the violence,” says Professor Kayyem, a former assistant secretary at the Department of Homeland Security. “Essentially, it’s either them or me.”                                                                                                                                By                Patrik Jonsson                                                                                            By                Harry Bruinius                                                                                                                                                                --  To unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to daily+unsubscribe@csps.com.",8/5/2019 0:00,,,Junk,,,FALSE,

5000g000028attpAAA,"Feature/Interview: Pastor Andrew Brunson's Upcoming Book is God's Hostage: A True Story of Persecution, Imprisonment & Perseverance","Hi Stephanie????? – I'm checking in to see if you have interest in receiving an ARC of God’s Hostage: A True Story of Persecution, Imprisonment and Perseverance by Pastor Andrew Brunson. Andrew’s story of being falsely accused and imprisoned in a Turkish prison for 735 days will be published this October to coincide with the one year anniversary of his release.  I’m including more information below on God’s Hostage and Andrew. Please let me know if you’d like to receive the book and/or talk with Andrew. Thank you.  Best,  Kate  Kate Knapp  212-966-4600 ext. 103  215-806-9332 (Mobile)  kate@rc-pr.com (mailto:kate@rc-pr.com)  Pastor Andrew Brunson Tells of Being Unjustly Held for 735 Days in a Turkish Prison:  God’s Hostage:  A True Story of Persecution, Imprisonment, and Perseverance  For more than 20 years, Andrew Brunson and his wife Norine had served as devoted Christian missionaries in Turkey. Following a 2016 coup attempt they had nothing to do with, in October of that year they were suddenly, and unjustly, arrested under suspicion of terrorism charges.  Not knowing any details about the allegations against them, and with little access to legal or consular help, the pair had no idea of the ordeal that had only just begun and would culminate two years later, with the world watching as the Trump administration took historic action to secure Andrew’s release.  In his upcoming book, God’s Hostage: A True Story of Persecution, Imprisonment, and Perseverance (October 15, 2019/Baker Books/$26.99), Andrew tells his remarkable story about being used as a political hostage by the Turkish president Erdogan and how Andrew believes that God used his imprisonment to orchestrate a worldwide prayer movement.  The story begins with the arrest of Andrew and Norine, and their spending two uncertain weeks locked in a cell together, not knowing what they were facing. After Norine is released, readers feel Andrew’s anxiety increase as he is suddenly alone, then transferred from one Turkish prison to another – each one worse than the last, from solitary confinement to maximum security - and at one point is locked in a cell meant to hold 8, but now holds 18 men…all Muslim except for him.  Facing three life sentences, readers feel Andrew’s utter helplessness as he deteriorates both physically and mentally. They see this devout man of Christ come to question his faith and ultimately ponder suicide. “I found myself plunged into the greatest crisis of faith and doubt that I had experienced in my life,” writes Andrew. “If God had decided to leave me here, or could not rescue me, then what hope did I have of ever getting out?”  All the while Andrew was struggling in prison, we learn of Norine’s desperate efforts to comfort him and keep him from hurting himself, to raise awareness of his plight with the United States government, and to bring people together to pray for her husband.  As Andrew is officially convicted in a sham court and is at his lowest point, readers follow as he has a revelation: because he believes in Jesus, he has eternal, ultimate freedom ahead of him. He decides to be firm in his faith moving forward. “My suffering was not the end of my story,” he writes.  As he is convicted, readers learn how Andrew’s story captures the attention of our government, with senators and representatives from both parties coming together, along with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Vice President Mike Pence, and President Trump himself fighting for his release. The world learns that Erdogan’s objective is to exchange Andrew for Imam Fethullah Gulen, who Erdogan blamed for the failed 2016 coup attempt and who now resides in the U.S. However, the U.S. takes a different route, placing sanctions and tariffs on Turkey – the first time the U.S. imposed trade sanctions or used the Magnitsky Act on a NATO ally. The world rejoices when Andrew is finally freed and leaves Turkey, and he is flown to the U.S. where he immediately meets with President Trump in the Oval office.  Why did this all take place? Andrew writes: “One of the main reasons is that there are millions of people who have prayed for Turkey. This was God’s plan all along. My assignment had been to help prepare for a spiritual harvest. Prison did not cut short my assignment, it served it in the most effective way. God used my imprisonment to orchestrate an unprecedented worldwide prayer movement.”  God’s Hostage: A True Story of Persecution, Imprisonment, and Perseverance hits bookstores and online retailers on October 15, 2019.    ______________________  If you would rather not receive future communications from Roslan & Campion Public Relations LLC, please go to https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/wf/click?upn=FamOzTP-2BmoG-2BpguzvA0HaxBKerZt5bBDy6opm8LiWJqz6UYplMG0o7MF4E1P5YsSvN7SGZO0ywYoQ8pcxrLRV3ntY6dOCRPGaAqVEv3d81M-2FDKglKMEdPfLmLLHMnd4Xf5txTF82qmpJV9ptFLb5tRmHZIUbkhUks-2BybDKJGpr3V0aiL-2FbAm4GkMmAj-2B7hLie9U6eU-2BQ-2Fc7RagHxYgk3tQ-3D-3D_6pchHAirW10eM8b14ZAlkZkRllITHdt0G4CIxpgEX-2FYMT-2FVtvkhkoxOwXdc140hQDKip1v9w6NG6f4yMNdzd3I0JbBoOspHl9BOjIgd0xs1-2B8Nb83O5w6sN-2FKjFdnoP8fEwYgK0qwA-2FFr0Y2RyV7jXb-2B35D1-2FgSLchLtpfdfqhL50qDVkCGeKiyQ8wVBza-2FHdhIC7Xs6aXyAgiWr9gIhX5bmKbrSyzcnZ8LYrSJHS2SP0B6RHIw6-2FuvCQlM-2FMG8YlCzhSInjLKB7iahl0az4-2BdiabzRzlCz43BExt9BBABDs5cQgDvmUflQn7IaKrDohsZ-2FutL2x2dFCnxbsCaWAYlGkLebXnY2YK2GkD4oWQUs-3D  Roslan & Campion Public Relations LLC, 200 Broadway, 3rd Floor, New York, NY 10038 United States  --  To unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to customerservice+unsubscribe@csps.com.",8/5/2019 0:00,,,Junk,,,FALSE,

Proverbs 3:18 She is a tree of life to those who take hold of her; those who hold her fast will be blessed. Proverbs 11:30 The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life, and the one who is wise saves lives. Proverbs 13:12 Hope deferred makes the heart sick, but a longing fulfilled is a tree of life. Proverbs 15:4 The soothing tongue is a tree of life, but a perverse tongue crushes the spirit. Isaiah 49:18 Lift up your eyes and look around; all your children gather and come to you. As surely as I live,” declares the Lord,  “you will wear them all as ornaments; you will put them on, like a bride. Isaiah 61:10 I delight greatly in the Lord; my soul rejoices in my God. For he has clothed me with garments of salvation and arrayed  me in a robe of his righteousness, as a bridegroom adorns his head like a priest, and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels. Isaiah 62:5 As a young man marries a young woman, so will your Builder marry you; as a bridegroom rejoices over his bride, so will your God rejoice over you.  --John 2:9 and the master of the banquet tasted the water that had been turned into wine. He did not realize where it had come from, though the servants who had  drawn the water knew. Then he called the bridegroom aside John 3:29 The bride belongs to the bridegroom. The friend who attends the bridegroom waits and listens for him, and is full of joy when he hears the bridegroom’s  voice. That joy is mine, and it is now complete. Revelation 19:7 Let us rejoice and be glad and give him glory! For the wedding of the Lamb has come, and his bride has made herself ready. Revelation 21:2 I saw the Holy City, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride beautifully dressed for her husband. Revelation 22:17 The Spirit and the bride say, “Come!” And let the one who hears say, “Come!” Let the one who is thirsty come; and let the one who wishes take  the free gift of the water of life. Isaiah 25:8 he will swallow up d/eat/h forever. The Sovereign Lord will wipe away the tears from all faces; he will remove his people’s disgrace from all the earth. The Lord has spoken. 1 Corinthians 15:54 When the perishable has been clothed with the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality, then the saying that is written will come true: “D/eat/h  has been swallowed up in victory.”  ---2 Corinthians 5:4 For while we are in this tent, we groan and are burdened, because we do not wish to be unclothed but to be clothed instead with our heavenly dwelling, so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life. Psalm 45:2 You are the most excellent of men and your lips have been anointed with grace, since God has blessed you forever. Proverbs 3:22 they will be life for you, an ornament to grace your neck. Proverbs 4:9 She will give you a garland to grace your head and present you with a glorious crown.” Isaiah 26:10 But when grace is shown to the wicked, they do not learn righteousness; even in a land of uprightness they go on doing evil and do not regard the majesty of the Lord. John 1:14 The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the one and only Son, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth. Acts 15:11 No! We believe it is through the grace of our Lord Jesus that we are saved, just as they are.”  ----Romans 15:15 Yet I have written you quite boldly on some points to remind you of them again, because of the grace God gave me 2 Corinthians 1:2 Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 2 Corinthians 4:15 All this is for your benefit, so that the grace that is reaching more and more people may cause thanksgiving to overflow to the glory of God. 2 Corinthians 6:1 As God’s co-workers we urge you not to receive God’s grace in vain. 2 Corinthians 8:7 But since you excel in everything—in faith, in speech, in knowledge, in complete earnestness and in the love we have kindled  in you—see that you also excel in this grace of giving. 2 Thessalonians 2:16 May our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God our Father, who loved us and by his grace gave us eternal encouragement and good hope,  Timothy 1:9 He has saved us and called us to a holy life—not because of anything we have done but because of his own purpose and grace. This grace was given us  in Christ Jesus before the beginning of time,  -----Titus 2:11 For the grace of God has appeared that offers salvation to all people. Hebrews 10:29 How much more severely do you think someone deserves to be punished who has trampled the Son of God underfoot, who has treated as an  unholy thing the blood of the covenant that sanctified them, and who has insulted the Spirit of grace? 1 Peter 1:10 Concerning this salvation, the prophets, who spoke of the grace that was to come to you, searched intently and with the greatest care, 1 Peter 4:10 Each of you should use whatever gift you have received to serve others, as faithful stewards of God’s grace in its various forms. 2 John 1:3 Grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and from Jesus Christ, the Father’s Son, will be with us in truth and love. Revelation 22:21 The grace of the Lord Jesus be with God’s people. Amen. John 4:23 Yet a time is coming and has now come when the true worshipers will worship the Father in the Spirit and in truth, for they are the kind of worshipers the Father seeks.  --- ---John 14:17 the Spirit of truth. The world cannot accept him, because it neither sees him nor knows him. But you know him, for he lives with you and will be in you. John 16:13 But when he, the Spirit of truth, comes, he will guide you into all the truth. He will not speak on his own; he will speak only what he hears, and he will tell you  what is yet to come. 1 John 5:6 This is the one who came by water and blood—Jesus Christ. He did not come by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit who testifies, because the Spirit is the truth. Proverbs 18:21 The tongue has the power of life and d/eat/h, and those who love it will eat its fruit. Proverbs 19:8 The one who gets wisdom loves life; the one who cherishes understanding will soon prosper. Proverbs 21:21 Whoever pursues righteousness and love finds life, prosperity and honor. John 15:13 Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one’s life for one’s friends.  --- - ---Galatians 5:13 [ Life by the Spirit ] You, my brothers and sisters, were called to be free. But do not use your freedom to indulge the flesh; rather, serve one another humbly in love. James 1:12 Blessed is the one who perseveres under trial because, having stood the test, that person will receive the crown of life that the Lord has promised to those who love him. 1 John 3:14 We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love each other. Anyone who does not love remains in death. Jude 1:21 keep yourselves in God’s love as you wait for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ to bring you to eternal life. Psalm 120:6 Too long have I lived among those who hate peace. Psalm 122:8 For the sake of my family and friends, I will say, “Peace be within you.” Proverbs 14:30 A heart at peace gives life to the body, but envy rots the bones.  Lords Chosen, Troy aka Life  PS.Isaiah 9:6 For to us a child is born, to us a son is given, and the government will be on his shoulders. And he will be called Wonderful Counselor,  Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. Isaiah 9:7 Of the greatness of his government and peace there will be no end. He will reign on David’s throne and over his kingdom, establishing and upholding it with justice and righteousness  from that time on and forever. The zeal of the Lord Almighty will accomplish this. Isaiah 32:17 The fruit of that righteousness will be peace; its effect will be quietness and confidence forever. Isaiah 48:18 If only you had paid attention to my commands, your peace would have been like a river, your well-being like the waves of the sea. Ezekiel 37:26 I will make a covenant of peace with them; it will be an everlasting covenant. I will establish them and increase their numbers,  and I will put my sanctuary among them forever. Malachi 2:5 “My covenant was with him, a covenant of life and peace, and I gave them to him; this called for reverence and he revered me and stood in awe of my name. Matthew 5:9 Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God. Category: Other Name: Troy and Christian Ethington",8/6/2019 0:00,,,Junk,,,FALSE,

He soon became one of the country’s leading forces in registering more young voters and voters of color, fighting climate change, working for racial justice, and helping secure better lives for all Americans. Tom has led a number of people-first, grassroots campaigns that have repeatedly defeated powerful special interests, beating big oil to win clean air laws, forcing big tobacco to pay its share of healthcare costs, and closing a billion-dollar corporate tax loophole to fund public schools.  Tom and his wife Kat Taylor were early signers of the Giving Pledge, a commitment to give the bulk of his fortune to good causes before they die. Tom’s dedication to doing what is right comes from his parents. His father was a lawyer who prosecuted Nazis at the Nuremberg Trials; his mother was a journalist and teacher who volunteered to teach prisoners in New York City jails. Tom says his parents showed him the power of having the courage to do the right thing. Their greatest lesson, he says, was that our actions speak louder than our words – what we do is more important than what we say.  ============================================================ Tom Steyer 2020 | P.O.

Each week, the editors select a new topic and lead article—often specially commissioned—plus supporting pieces from the archives that address something that needs prayerful watching in world thought.

Seth is an 18-year-old who just graduated from high school and will attend Auburn University in the Fall studying Computer Engineering.  In its 18^th year, the competition attracted more than 850,000 test-takers from 119 countries.  Students, ages 13 to 22, competed with peers to prove their superior skills in Microsoft Word, Excel and PowerPoint, culminating in the most popular technology skills competition on Microsoft Office—and the only one endorsed by Microsoft since its inception in 2002.  To enter the competition, students took a qualifying Microsoft Office Specialist certification exam to demonstrate their mastery of Microsoft Office technology.  Regional competitions were held worldwide and 155 student finalists from 50 countries qualified to compete in the final round of competition in New York, New York, USA from July 28 – 31.  In the concluding round, competitors participated in unique, project-based tests to demonstrate their ability to use advanced features and create a presentation in PowerPoint. Certiport and Microsoft recognized the top student competitors at the MOS World Championship Awards Ceremony at the New York City Marriott Marquis and presented each first-place winner with a $7,000 cash prize, second-place with $3,500 and third-place with $1,500.

""Let's get our members to fund raise"" (it's never worked...it never will) 4. ""Let's recruit more board members"" (why add to the crazy-making?) 5.

Your Board of Directors is not your real problem nor is it your solution. When it's all said and done, there's one thing all boards have in common...THEY DO NOT FUNCTION. There's a better way. Let me further share with you the WRONG WAY to build your board. Find 15 busy community leaders…ask them do 120 hours of free work per year…then MAKE THEM PAY YOU (every board member has to give)…after they've paid, explain that the work you need them to do is something they've never done, are not going to be good at, and will never want to do...FUNDRAISING! It defies reasoning, does it not? Yet, nonprofit professionals around the world peddle this silliness, despite the fact that it doesn’t work AND IT NEVER WILL.  Have you heard this one, “Never try to teach a pig to sing; it wastes your time and it annoys the pig.”  I promise you there's a better way...and it doesn't involve your board.  National Development Institute (NDI) will celebrate it's 30th Anniversary in 2020 and has inspired charitable executives to raise hundreds of millions of dollars for nonprofits in the U.S. and around the world. How? By training over 16,000 nonprofit leaders to implement the Major Gifts Ramp-Up Model. Where there is a dream there is always an answer and for nonprofits that answer is MAJOR GIFTS RAMP-UP.  Did you know that THOUSANDS OF MILLIONAIRE DONORS live in your community?  NDI's Major Gifts Ramp-Up Event will show you how you can reach these donors who already believe in your mission but have yet to hear about the important work you do every day.  Why Donors?  The old adage, there are things in life that are more important than money, is about as silly as saying there are things in life that are more important than air. Money, like air, in and of itself is not very impressive, nor does it give life meaning. However, life has very little meaning…if you can’t breathe! Like Logan Pearsall Smith said, ""There are few sorrows, however poignant, in which a good income is of no avail.""  So, here's some of the ""big ideas"" we cover at a Major Gifts Ramp-Up Event:  - MONEY IS OXYGEN! Without it you can't breathe. Financial Capacity-Building is the key. - FEASIBILITY STUDIES ARE A RACKET. Stop paying in to the scam. - IT'S NOT ABOUT YOUR BOARDS! Nonprofits succeed because of STRONG CEOs. - STOP REQUIRING YOUR BOARD TO FUNDRAISE! It's never worked and never will. - GET EVERYTHING YOU NEED. More staff, more volunteers, more donors, MORE MONEY!  Here's what major donors have to say about these events.  ""Two words…AMAZING EXPERIENCE.  Missouri’s Major Gifts Ramp-Up Event was provocative and pushed our agency directors to ‘re-imagine’ their roles as CEOs!  (I’ve received only positive comments from those who attended.)  NDI challenged us to see charity through a new lens and then gave us the tools we needed to change. Our own United Way staff were inspired and are now poised for unprecedented campaign success. If you believe in nonprofit capacity-building than this program is for you.”  - Debbie Meeds, Grantmaking CEO, Springfield, MI  “Having served nonprofits for the past 40 years, I thought I'd seen everything! Then I attended Major Gifts Ramp-Up New York and experienced Jimmy LaRose’s brilliant performance before hundreds of nonprofit executives. His unbounded enthusiasm, comic timing, exceptional sense of theater and insights into nonprofit management will change the way you view yourself and the raising of big gifts. This conference is a must-see, especially for those who think they’ve seen it all!” - Deborah Bowie, Grantmaking CEO, Gainesville, FL  “I’ve spent the last week receiving email messages, phone calls and personal visits thanking me for bringing Major Gifts Ramp-Up to the Gulf Coast. Our agencies LOVED IT! This spectacular 2-day capacity-building conference was daring, confrontational and exactly what our organizations needed in the way of training.  Conventional methods of management and fundraising were challenged with humor and insight. Their expert faculty engaged our grantees and inspired them to grow revenues in new ways that work.  Prepare for significant change if you give your community the gift of Major Gifts Ramp-Up. Feel free to call me with your questions!” - Cliff Grimes, Grantmaking CEO, Mobile, AL  Simply put, Major Gifts Ramp-Up is both provocative and entertaining and may very well be the most important training event you attend in your career.  Please let me challenge you to take a minute and register for this event today. I look forward to hearing from you. Until then I remain,  Sincerely Yours,  Aimee Vance, CNC  NDI Faculty  P.S. Who should attend? Nonprofit Executives, Board Members, Development Officers, Pastors, Trustees, Volunteers, Special Event Coordinators, Marketing Directors and PR Staff, who want to increase their knowledge and skills in the areas of nonprofit advancement, fundraising, and development.

5000g000028b6ryAAA,"Resolutely Black: Conversations with Françoise Vergès, by Aimé Césaire","Publishing October 20,2019   ** ------------------------------------------------------------  Aimé Césaire’s work is foundational for colonial and postcolonial thought. His Discourse on Colonialism, first published in 1955, influenced generations of scholars and activists at the forefront of liberation struggles in Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean and it remains a classic of anticolonial thought. His notion of the boomerang-effect of slavery and colonialism and his scathing critique of the French left for its failure to see racism as central to the struggle for liberation remain highly relevant to current debates.  This unique volume takes the form of a series of interviews with Césaire that were conducted by Françoise Vergès in 2004, shortly before his death. Césaire’s responsesto Vergès’ questions cover a wide range of topics, including the origins of his political activism, the legacies of slavery and colonialism, the question of reparation for slavery and the problems of marrying literature to politics. His responses resonate today with such contentious issues as the boundaries of citizenship and the immigration question. Who should be considered a citizen of a nation? Should a state recognize slavery as a crime against humanity? What role did the colonies and its inhabitants play in the modernization of metropolitan centers? The book includes a substantial postface by Vergès in which she situates Césaire’s work in its intellectual and political context.  This timely book brings Césaire back into the present-day conversation on race, slavery and the legacy of colonialism. It will be of great interest to students and scholars throughout the humanities and social sciences and it will have a wide general readership.   Aimé Césaire (1913-2008) was born in Basse-Pointe, Martinique, and was an anticolonial theorist, activist, writer and poet.  Françoise Vergès has held the Global South(s) Professorship at the Maison des sciences de l’homme, Paris.

5000g000028b3zrAAA,"FEAT/INT: “I Got It From My Mama"" Exercising While Pregnant Could Boost Baby Health","Dear Stephanie,  Research continues to emerge about the benefits of staying active while pregnant, but scientists now believe (https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2019-08-01/could-exercise-in-pregnancy-boost-babys-health-too) expectant mothers who exercise give birth to babies with stronger movement skills. Whether you’re already active or new to working out, it’s important to understand the do’s and don’ts of exercising while pregnant.  Now, Dr. Kate Mihevc-Edwards (http://www.katemihevcedwards.com/) and Dr. Blair Green (https://www.catalystga.com/) are revealing the ultimate guide to staying active for expectant and postpartum women, Go Ahead, Stop & Pee.  “I have seen and felt the lack of support women receive during pregnancy and postpartum around exercise and running,” says Dr. Kate-Mihevc Edwards. “There needs to be better education surrounding exercise for women during pregnancy and postpartum. Motherhood has so many joys and showing your kids that you’re strong and active is just one of them.”  Available for interviews, Q&As, and bylines, Dr. Mihevc-Edwards and Dr. Green can discuss:  · The nine most common misconceptions about running while pregnant  · How your body will transform during pregnancy—from your heart, muscles and bones to your urine output and stride length · Important exercises for pregnant runners to make sure their routines are safe · The positive physical and psychological effects of maintaining an active lifestyle for soon-to-be mothers · Postpartum bodies: What new mothers need to know in order to understand and care for their bodies after pregnancy   Please let me know if you’re interested in speaking with Dr. Edwards and Dr. Green and/or receiving a copy of their forthcoming book.

5000g000028b5ZeAAI,Steyer Joins Top Tier of Democratic Presidential Candidates in Morning Consult Poll,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: Tuesday, August 6, 2019 CONTACT: press@tomsteyer.com Steyer Joins Top Tier of Democratic Presidential Candidates in Morning Consult Poll  (San Francisco, August 6, 2019) — Yesterday, Morning Consult released new polling of early primary state voters (https://morningconsult.com/2020-democratic-primary/) , showing Tom Steyer in fifth place with 6%, putting him in the top tier of Democratic presidential candidates, beating Pete Buttigieg and within striking distance of Kamala Harris.  “Having just entered the race four weeks ago, Team Steyer is proud of this milestone. Tom has been delivering his message of taking back our democracy across the country, and it is resonating with the American people,” said Campaign Manager Heather Hargreaves. “Voters in the early primary states are clearly responding to Tom’s message. Whether by impeachment or by the ballot box, Tom Steyer will remove Donald Trump from the presidency.”  Tom Steyer will be traveling to Iowa this weekend to meet with voters and attend a number of political events.  Paid for by Tom Steyer 2020.  ###  About Tom:  Tom Steyer left his successful investing business seven years ago to give his own money and all his time and energy to fighting for progressive causes. He soon became one of the country’s leading forces in registering more young voters and voters of color, fighting climate change, working for racial justice, and helping secure better lives for all Americans. Tom has led a number of people-first, grassroots campaigns that have repeatedly defeated powerful special interests, beating big oil to win clean air laws, forcing big tobacco to pay its share of healthcare costs, and closing a billion-dollar corporate tax loophole to fund public schools.  Tom and his wife Kat Taylor were early signers of the Giving Pledge, a commitment to give the bulk of his fortune to good causes before they die. Tom’s dedication to doing what is right comes from his parents. His father was a lawyer who prosecuted Nazis at the Nuremberg Trials; his mother was a journalist and teacher who volunteered to teach prisoners in New York City jails. Tom says his parents showed him the power of having the courage to do the right thing. Their greatest lesson, he says, was that our actions speak louder than our words – what we do is more important than what we say.  ============================================================ Tom Steyer 2020 | P.O.

Image   Faure Gnassingbé rend hommage à l’icône de la musique togolaise, Jimi Hope décédé ce lundi à Paris  Lomé, le 05 Août 2019-  Le Chef de l'État, SEM Faure Gnassingbé a salué la mémoire de l'artiste togolais Jimi Hope décédé dans la nuit du dimanche 4 au lundi 5 août 2019 à Paris des suites d’une courte maladie.  Le Président de la République dans un message posté sur son compte twitter a exprimé ses sincères compassion et condoléances à la famille de l'illustre disparu. « Je salue la mémoire de l'illustre défunt. Un grand homme qui honore notre pays », a laissé le Président Faure Gnassingbé sur son compte Twitter.  « Jimi Hope était un ami, un artiste contemporain accompli qui rend le peuple togolais fier de sa culture, ses convictions, sa foi, sa vision de l’art africain et universaliste nous manqueront à tout jamais. Je tiens à exprimer à l'endroit de sa famille toute la reconnaissance et les condoléances du peuple togolais », a-t-il ajouté.  De son vrai nom Koffi SENAYA, Jimi Hope est un artiste chanteur et plasticien très connu et aimé du public togolais. Cet auteur, compositeur et chanteur est également un maître de la scène musicale de par ses prestations en concert-live et sa capacité à faire chanter et mouvoir les foules aux rythmes du blues, du soul et du rock, en Afrique et à travers le monde.  Avec plus de douze albums à son actif, Jimi Hope a connu une carrière internationale incontestable. « Blues for Hope » est le titre de son dernier album lancé au cours d’une émission sur Canal Plus à Paris, en mars 2012.  Image  Le Ministre Koutéra Bataka participe à Kigali au forum sur la sécurité alimentaire en Afrique  Lomé, le 05 Août 2019-  Un forum de haut niveau sur la sécurité alimentaire en Afrique se tient depuis ce lundi 5 août 2019 à Kigali dans la capitale du Rwanda. Le Togo y participe avec une délégation conduite par le Ministre de l’agriculture, de la production animale et halieutique, Noël Koutéra Bataka.  La cérémonie d’ouverture des travaux a été présidée par le Président rwandais, Paul Kagamé. La rencontre est organisée par le gouvernement rwandais en collaboration avec la Commission de l’UA, la FAO, la BAD, le FIDA et la Banque Mondiale. Elle réunit pendant deux jours des Chefs d’Etat, des ministres de l’agriculture et des finances, des chefs d’institutions internationales, des experts et des acteurs du secteur agricole.  D'après les organisateurs, ce forum va permettre de créer une synergie d'actions et la mobilisation des financements afin de faire face à l’aggravation de la crise de la sécurité alimentaire sur le continent, dans un contexte de changement climatique.  Il sera question pour les parties prenantes d'élaborer un document permettant de formaliser l’engagement de tous les partenaires à mieux coordonner et à faciliter les actions communes pour relever le défi de la sécurité alimentaire en Afrique.  Le forum sera une occasion pour le Ministre togolais en charge de l’agriculture, Koutéra Bataka d’échanger avec des partenaires en vue de développer le secteur agricole au Togo. Un secteur qui pèse 40% du Produit Intérieur Brut (PIB) et emploie près de 70% de la population active.  Le Togo est aujourd’hui à l’abri de l’insécurité alimentaire grâce aux différents programmes mis en œuvre par le gouvernement et qui ont permis sur les trois dernières années de réaliser des excédents alimentaires.  Maintenant, le pays nourrit l’ambition de transformer son agriculture pour en faire le moteur de croissance de son économie à l’horizon 2022. Une ambition à laquelle l’axe stratégique 2 du Plan National de Développement, s’attelle de réaliser.  Image   La clôture de la Foire Made in Togo reportée au 12 août   Lomé, le 05 Août 2019-   Alors qu’elle devrait prendre fin ce lundi 5 août 2019, la 3ème édition de la Foire Made in Togo a été prorogée d’une semaine.  Les organisateurs ont donc décidé d’ajouter 7 jours supplémentaires à l’évènement, reportant ainsi au lundi 12 août prochain sa clôture. Ceci, en raison du fort engouement suscité par cette foire et de la massive participation enregistrée depuis son ouverture le 26 juillet dernier sur le site du CETEF à Lomé.  Evénement annuel organisé courant juillet-août, sous l’égide du ministère du Commerce, de l’Industrie, du Développement du secteur privé et de la Promotion de la consommation locale, la Foire Made in Togo vise selon les organisateurs à assurer une meilleure visibilité des produits locaux, tout en encourageant leur consommation et leur exportation.  La Foire est dédiée à l’exposition et à la promotion des produits fabriqués au Togo. C’est également une manière pour les organisateurs d’encourager l’entrepreneuriat des jeunes. Axée cette année sur le thème de la valorisation et de la consommation des produits locaux, elle regroupe plus de 300 exposants.  L’Ambassade des Etats-Unis au Togo est le grand parrain de cette édition. Avec cette prolongation d’une semaine, les organisateurs espèrent franchir et dépasser le cap des 150 000 visiteurs annoncés avant le début de la Foire.  Image   Les professionnels des médias sont en formation à Kpalimé, sur l’investigation journalistique et la cybercriminalité  Lomé, le 05 Août 2019-  Le Conseil national des patrons de presse (CONAPP) organise à partir de ce lundi 5 août à Kpalimé, un séminaire de formation à l’endroit de 80 patrons de presse et journalistes de terrain, sur des thématiques de la cybercriminalité et du journalisme d’investigation.  La formation est assurée par l’ONG, Reporter Sans Frontières. Pendant trois jours, ces professionnels des médias vont se mettre à l'école du journalisme d'investigation et de la lutte contre la cybercriminalité.  A l'ouverture des travaux ce lundi, le président du CONAPP, El-Hadj Arimiyao Tchagnao s'est réjoui de la « grande mobilisation » des professionnels des médias autours de cette rencontre et a exprimé ses remerciements à l'endroit de l'ONG Reporters Sans Frontières qui soutient l'initiative.  Un geste de reconnaissance bien accueilli par le représentant Afrique de l'Ouest de Reporters Sans Frontières, Hassane Diagne. Reporters Sans Frontières, a-t-il dit, a ouvert son bureau en janvier à Dakar qui couvre toute l'Afrique de l'Ouest. Ceci a été fait pour permettre d'être plus proche des acteurs des médias et de sentir au mieux les préoccupations des journalistes.  Reporters Sans Frontières place ses interventions sur quatre axes à savoir la recherche et la publication des exactions en matière de presse, l'assistance aux journalistes et aux professionnels des médias en difficulté et à leurs familles et la formation des journalistes. « La sécurité physique et numérique des journalistes, les normes journalistiques, la couverture des élections, le journalisme d'investigation et les questions de genre sont des thématiques qui intéressent Reporters Sans Frontières », a indiqué Hassane Diagne.  Le représentant du ministère de la Communication, des Sports, de la formation à la citoyenneté et au civisme, Ambroise Klevor n'a pas manqué d'exprimer lui aussi, ses félicitations au CONAPP pour le « dynamisme » de son bureau actuel et ses remerciements à l'endroit de Reporters Sans Frontières pour son accompagnement.  Le journalisme évolue, la pratique aussi et il faut approfondir les sujets d'actualité et sensibiliser les citoyens afin que ces derniers fassent évoluer la compréhension des citoyens sur les grands sujets sociaux, a indiqué Ambroise Klevor dans son discours de circonstance. Le séminaire se tient jusqu’au 7 août.

And because it’s so easy, I created easy chia pudding (three ways) so that you can set yourself up for success in the mornings!”  If you haven’t tried chia pudding, it’s essentially just milk of some sort and chia seeds! The chia seeds expand and make the milk a pudding like texture that is perfect for topping with fruits, granola, and more for a healthy breakfast or snack.  Leigh Ann suggests using full fat coconut milk “because of the creamy texture and flavor that the coconut milk gives the pudding, but you can also use regular dairy or almond milk here. Chia seeds are full of omega 3’s, fiber, and protein making them ideal for kickstarting your day off right.”  You can literally top chia pudding with whatever ingredients you have on hand, but here Leigh Ann created three different puddings utilizing fruits currently in season: Strawberry Rhubarb compote + granola; Brown Sugar peach; and Blueberry Banana.  Leigh Ann suggests prepping a week’s worth of chia puddings in mason jars and then simply top them in the morning with your desired toppings!    Recipe/photos may be reprinted with the following credit: Recipes/photos reprinted with permission by Leigh Ann Chatagnier / www.MyDiaryofUs.com (https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/wf/click?upn=84Em28S1K9SvtzcUtu04EoNjoV7ilyR5ldb8JkSohAm2c605MicLpP9GP68GFJi9_6pchHAirW10eM8b14ZAlkZkRllITHdt0G4CIxpgEX-2FYMT-2FVtvkhkoxOwXdc140hQDKip1v9w6NG6f4yMNdzd3I0JbBoOspHl9BOjIgd0xs0uc85rFSBFSBs-2BlN1-2FE9HeoMVziTSOALDhbGeyHZFJJAkFL748FBzRoisfx35r-2FKAm9l42L11qfCpbIwX04RuR2bQJpJSomxyRzH1efpVrZ7EYd6Tg0O17eZzCEkezOtNg0Au3QdVSkuaDBEZ22fHwKEO3-2BhvhYm0Mprp8OZZE9BHU5nGGUFB1njkQ84TwZtq0cMJjbLSuGye9VtzAnGhkJg2yitMrKshIWxKBkROV-2FDoYarEruUzP4oUqKzR5Zxo-3D  Easy Chia Pudding, Three Ways  Ingredients: 1 Cup Full Fat Coconut Milk 1/4 Cup + 2 Tbsp.

Strawberry Rhubarb Compote:  1 Cup Strawberries 1/2 Cup Diced Rhubarb 1 Tsp. Lemon Juice 1 Tsp. Vanilla 2 Tbsp. Honey or Maple Syrup  Brown Sugar Peaches: 1 Large Peach 1 Tsp. Brown Sugar 1 Tbsp. Grass Fed Butter Pinch of Salt  Other Toppings: Blueberries Banana Honey Granola  Directions:  Make strawberry rhubarb compote by combining all ingredients (minus the honey) into a saucepan and cooking until berries and rhubarb are soft.  Blend until smooth and then stir in honey once cooled. (This is delicious on toast and more!)  Make peaches by sautéing in a pan until sugar has coated the peaches and they are slightly soft.  Store in the fridge until ready to use.  Make chia pudding by combining coconut milk, chia seeds, maple syrup, and vanilla in a mason jar and stir to combine.  Place into the fridge for at least an hour, but up to overnight until the chia seeds thicken the milk.  Top with desired toppings and serve.  Note: Add more chia seeds for a thicker pudding, and less for a thinner pudding. I find everyone has a preference to how they prefer the texture of their chia pudding!

Email Address *   allisonhtd@gmail.com Share your Comments: *  In my humble opinion, we need better wording so we don't give the appearance of Christian Science teaching that mortals are the children of God - especially ones who commit violence. Or, that seeing a criminal as the child of God is somehow a healing view.  Or, that everything is ok because God couldn't have caused a murder.  This subject needs more deep, tender, sensitive consideration.  There is a missed opportunity here for sharing that CS teaches that the mortal experience is the Adam dream, and in reality, God's children are safe, protected, loved and never in danger - because they are spiritual.  Also, how could someone feel peace if a perpetrator of a violent act was ""...free from capture""?  I wouldn't!  I'd be concerned for others in the community.  I would need to know that error will be arrested so that others will be safe.  That struck me as very odd, cold, and uncaring.  I need reassurance that God is just, and in control and that evil cannot escape truth. ""Mortals are the counterfeits of immortals.  They are the children of the wicked one, or the one evil, which declares that man begins in dust or as a material embryo.  In divine Science, God and the real man are inseparable as divine Principle and idea."" (Science and Health, pg 476)  Comment Publication *  Please do not publish my comment.

My most recent reporting trip was to the Arctic Circle. In between I have written for the Monitor from every continent except Antarctica.  In the past I have also contributed to other newspapers and magazines. But the Monitor is special. Nowhere else have I felt so free to seek out the rays of light that illuminate even the darkest places. And as a foreign correspondent, I have been to some pretty dark places – Chechnya and Central America, Baghdad and Fukushima.  Even in the midst of war and disaster, though, I’ve always come across stories that give me hope – stories of courage and resilience and imagination. Telling those stories is not a question of being a Pollyanna – it’s a matter of keeping your eyes open. And keeping your eyes open is the first rule of good journalism.  Wars and disasters are only a small part of what my foreign correspondent colleagues and I write about in the Monitor. Most of the time we are trying to explain what’s going on in the world. That is not simple because the world is not a simple place.  But we go about our jobs in a distinctively Monitor manner, sifting out ideas and values from the helter-skelter of news headlines. In doing so, we produce journalism that helps compassionate global thinkers explore the world's most pressing challenges and be part of the solutions.  If you are interested not only in how the world works but in reading about people who are making it work better – in big ways and small – The Christian Science Monitor is for you. Its team of foreign correspondents act as your discerning eyes and ears, sparing you chaff and chatter but getting to the bottom of things in an appealing and readable way.  So remember: Keep your eyes open. You’ll be amazed at what you’ll see.

5000g000028b3kyAAA,Back to Bullying & Other Challenges: How Students Can Advocate for Themselves in Sept.,"Hi Stephanie,  Back to school might mean back to bullying, and other challenges for students of all ages.  Heather Hansen (https://heatherhansenpresents.com/) , partner at O’Brien and Ryan law firm, anchor at the Law and Crime network, host of The Elegant Warrior podcast and author of The Elegant Warrior: How to Win Life’s Trials Without Losing Yourself [Page Two, April 2019], is available for interviews to teach students how to advocate for themselves. She can address two audiences in particular:  1. Parents of young children who are going to school and need to learn to advocate for themselves with other students and teachers  2.  College students who need to advocate for themselves and stay safe.   Hansen’s advice for young children and parents of young children:  As your children head out for the new school year, they will face new challenges. They will need to learn to advocate for themselves effectively. You can help by teaching them the 4 Ps.   Pause—they don’t have to react right away. Most of the time if they are facing a bully or a “mean” teacher, there’s time to walk away and address it later.   Plan-then they can come home and plan for their advocacy. This is where questions come in. How could they handle the problem? What do they want to say? How do they want to say it?   Practice—playing it out with your children is a great way to make sure they are not only ready, but comfortable. I’d never step into trial without practicing, and your kids shouldn’t face their trials without practice either. (nor should adults!)  Play-when they get into the situation, all they have to do is “press play” on what they’ve prepped and practiced. They can go into the situation confident that they have the tools they need and that the conversation or interaction could even be fun!  This type of preparation also makes children much more likely to respond well when they don’t have time for the 4 Ps!  Hansen’s advice for college students:  As college students head out to their new lives without their parents, they will face new challenges. Some of those are hard, especially in the time of MeToo, frat hazing and social media bullying. Here are some ways they can advocate for themselves in tough situations, using the word DORM as guidance.   D-Discover. First, discover yourself. You can’t advocate for yourself until you know what you want and what you don’t want. Also this is the time to learn your limits with respect to drinking, relationships, and social media.   O-Object. You have to learn to object when you don’t like something. I was petrified the first time I objected in the courtroom. But no one can set your boundaries but you. When you know what you don’t want, it is time to use your voice and set those boundaries. Objections take practice so start small. Don’t be afraid to say “ I don’t like that”  R-Recognize tone and body language College kids need to know that bodies and voices can tell them as much as words do. Tone of voice is especially helpful, as studies show you can tell more about a person’s emotion from their tone of voice than their facial expressions. If they can read tone of voice, they may hear danger before they see it.   M-Move. When you feel uncomfortable, read a weird tone in a voice, don’t like someone’s body language, or don’t like the response to your objection, you can leave. Don’t be afraid to move your body. Sometimes confidence follows.   Are you interested in scheduling an interview? I’m also happy to send a book your way.  More about Hansen is below.  Thanks in advance for your consideration and feedback.  Have a great day,  Joelle  HEATHER HANSEN is a trial lawyer, consultant and professional speaker. She has defended medical malpractice cases for over twenty years, was recently inducted into the American College of Trial Lawyers and is consistently named one of the Top 50 Female Attorneys in the state of Pennsylvania. Heather works as a communication consultant, combining her courtroom experience with her psychology degree and her training as a mediator to help her clients ask better questions, master objections, and use credible persuasion to succeed. She has appeared on CNN, NBC, Fox News Channel, and Good Day Philadelphia, and is the host of The Elegant Warrior podcast. Heather lives in New York City.

5000g000028awipAAA,Consumer Alert from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) -- Worshipers targeted by gift card scam,"Dear Colleague,  The Federal Trade Commission<ftc.gov>, the nation's consumer protection agency, is alerting religious leaders around the country about a gift card scam targeting worshipers.  The FTC alert, Worshipers targeted by gift card scam<https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2019/07/worshipers-targeted-gift-card-scam>, explains that scammers pretend to be a pastor, rabbi, priest, imam, or bishop and then ask worshipers for gift card contributions for a worthy cause. Appeals are often made by email, but we've heard people are also getting texts and phone calls, too.  The imposter asks people to buy a popular gift card - frequently, iTunes, Google Play, or Amazon - and then asks for the gift card number and PIN on the back of the card. Those numbers let the scammer immediately get the money people loaded onto the card. And once that's done, the scammer and peoples' money are gone, usually without a trace. But, as outlined in the alert, there are things people should do if they paid a scammer with a gift card<https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/paying-scammers-gift-cards#Paid>.

That interview has gained a lot of notoriety since it was aired. Even Donald Trump, Jr. weighed in to criticize Lemon's approach.  I have to admit, I got a bit of a chuckle out of learning that I went from a ""pastor"" to a ""controversial pastor"" in the CNN display under my image - just because I didn't back off of my opinion about the president.  Now, I have been invited on Laura Ingraham's show to discuss that interview in more depth. I'll be on tonight (Monday, August 5th). So be sure to tune in to the Ingraham Angle at 10pm (EDT) on Fox News to watch!  For faith, family and freedom, Rev. Bill Owens  P.S.

5000g000028b6DoAAI,Editorial comments and corrections,"The following information was collected:  Name: John  Email: robledoint@yahoo.com  Subscriber: No  Subject: What Elijah Cummings Is Trying To Hide About Corruption In Balimore ( And On His Congressional Panel!)  Product: csmonitor.com  Message: What Elijah Cummings Is Trying to Hide About Corruption in Baltimore (And On His Congressional Panel!)  (TPP) – Last week’s news cycle was absolutely dominated by the fact that the President of the United States pointed out that a corrupt, crime-ridden, Democratic-run city was, well, corrupt and crime-ridden because it was run by Democrats!  The Democrat-media complex scrambled to loudly accuse him of racism, clutching their pearls and waxing hysterical all week long.  They also, without a second thought, adamantly defended the state of a city where schools don’t have the funds to heat classrooms in the winter, 13 of the city’s high schools have literally no children that are proficient in math, the murder rate is higher than New York City’s and twice that of Chicago’s, and just recently the mayor was forced to resign amid evedience of corruption and embezzlement.  Methinks the Dems did protest too much.  You see, the truth of the matter is that everyone already knew that President Trump was absolutely right about Baltimore.  To begin with, millions in federal funding cannot be accounted for in Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD)’s fair home city.  Breitbart reports:  The city of Baltimore cannot account for the billions of dollars it receives in federal funding as crime, drugs, and rats run rampant in the city, according to a recent report on the city’s expenses.  According to a 2018 audit of the city’s finances provided by USASpending.gov, Baltimore received $5.44 billion in federal grants, contracts, and other financial assistance.  Baltimore city is just part of Rep. Elijah Cumming’s (D-MD) district, which received more than $9 billion in federal funding over the past year and more than $15 billion over the past two years of his current congressional session.  Institutions such as Johns Hopkins University, Johns Hopkins Medical Services Corp, and University of Maryland’s research and medical care programs get $3 billion in federal funding, the Baltimore Sun reported.  “Baltimore over the past five years has received $900 million in just operating and capital expenses that doesn’t include the billions of dollars going to the different agencies,” David Williams with the Taxpayers Protection Alliance told WBFF. “For example $1.1 billion has gone toward the housing authority in Baltimore.  But the problem is, millions of the $5.44 billion in federal grants remain “unaccounted for,” with many of the awarded amounts showing up as $0 in the audit for entries like “Baltimore City Mayor’s Office,” “Baltimore City Housing Police,” “Baltimore City Health Department,” and “Baltimore City Public School Systems.”  Then there is the jaw-dropping muder rate in the city Democrats are currently defending. The Washington Examiner reported  In an analysis of the murder rates done after President Trump criticized Baltimore Rep. Elijah Cummings over the weekend, Baltimore’s was reported at 56 per 100,000. The city is on track for 340 murders.  By comparison, said the Princeton Policy Advisors analysis, the murder rate in El Salvador was 50, in Guatemala it was 22 and Honduras was 38.    Let’s also not forget that Rep. Cummings himself, who has been playing the victim hard through this whole thing, is currently under investigation for corruption.  Also from the Examiner:  A watchdog group is asking the Maryland attorney general to investigate whether Rep. Elijah Cummings and his wife used a charity for improper self-enrichment, according to a copy of the complaint obtained by the Washington Examiner.  The Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust, which leans conservative, filed the complaint on Monday against the Center for Global Policy Solutions, a nonprofit organization founded by Cummings’ wife, Maya Rockeymoore.  The complaint asked Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh to investigate the financial relationship between the Center for Global Policy Solutions and Rockeymoore’s for-profit consulting firm, Global Policy Solutions LLC.  The similarly named entities shared an address, phone number, projects, funding sources, and had a cost-sharing arrangement that raises questions about a “potentially improper financial benefit to Ms. Maya Rockeymoore Cummings and her husband, Representative Elijah Cummings,” the complaint asserts.  “This is a unique situation that warrants necessary oversight to maintain public confidence in nonprofit donations,” said FACT’s executive director Kendra Arnold in a letter to Frosh.  Rockeymoore’s foundation came under scrutiny earlier this year after the Washington Examiner reported that the foundation had accepted millions of dollars from corporations and special interest groups with business before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, a committee led by Cummings, a Maryland congressman.  Rockeymoore’s nonprofit group received over $6.2 million in grants between 2013 and 2016 from special interest groups and corporations. Several of the nonprofit group’s financial backers, which included Google, J.P. Morgan, and Prudential, have business interests before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. Cummings has served as Democratic chairman of the committee since January and previously served as ranking member.",8/6/2019 0:00,CSM,CSM.com,Junk,,,FALSE,

5000g000028b15LAAQ,Special Paws: Beautiful Children's Story Shares The Daydreams Of Shelter Dogs Awaiting Their Forever Home,"Dear Stephanie Hanes :  I would like to send a copy of Special Paws: The Family List in consideration of an interview or review from you. Tracey Kusinitz Altman was 50 years old when she got her very first dog and it changed her life forever! Her beautifully illustrated children's book—first in a series featuring shelter animals—was inspired by her experiences adopting shelter dogs. This heartwarming tale shares the daydreams of two shelter dogs as they await their forever family, and encourages families to adopt—not shop.  Please read the following press release and let me know if I may schedule an interview with the author, or send a copy of the book for a review from you. If you wish to do a feature story, I'd be happy to provide JPEGs of Tracey and the book cover. Thank you.  Jaime Sanders Ascot Media Group, Inc. Post Office Box 2394 Friendswood, TX 77549 news@ascotmedianews.com ascotmedia.com 281.333.3507 Phone 800.854.2207 Fax  (This press release may be reprinted in part or entirety by any print or broadcast media outlet, or used by any means of social media sharing)  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  **Special Paws: Beautiful Children's Story Shares The Daydreams Of Shelter Dogs Awaiting Their Forever Home**  **Dallas/Fort Worth, TX, August 5, 2019** — When a sleepy-eyed Boston awakes and finds herself in new surroundings, she is full of questions! Beside her is an engaging, friendly beagle named Hunter, who quickly becomes Boston's friend and explains that they are in an animal shelter. As their friendship deepens and their dreams of finding their forever-homes take shape, Hunter helps Boston create a very special list of everything she is looking for in a family. Readers young and old will enjoy the playful dialogue — and maybe catch a glimpse of their own feelings toward family — as both dogs reveal what's most important to them in a forever home.  Special Paws: The Family List, is the heartwarming new tale from Tracey Kusinitz Altman. The 38-page children's book is beautifully illustrated in vibrant colors by Joseba Morales. Inspired by Altman's own experiences with adopting dogs from a local shelter, Special Paws is both entertaining and educational, and is sure to be enjoyed by children and dog lovers young and old. Proceeds from the sale of the book will benefit the Special Paws nonprofit organization, which supports the efforts of area animal shelters.  Author Tracey Kusinitz Altman was 50 years old when she got her very first dog. Before going to the shelter to look for a pet, a friend had helped Altman put together a list of qualities that she wanted in a dog. Boston, a beautiful terrier and pit bull mix, fit everything on the list and more. The spots on Boston's back formed the shape of a heart, and for Altman it was love at first sight. She drew from her own experience with the local animal shelter to write Special Paws, the first in a planned series of children's books that feature shelter animals. She also founded Special Paws, a nonprofit that raises money to support animal shelters. Altman lives in the Dallas/Fort Worth area with her two rescue dogs, Boston and Harper. You can connect with Altman on Facebook at Special Paws.

Small Acts on Online Kindness For our Kids and Teens (and us)   Not all screen time is created equal. The more we, and our kids, use screen time for good, the better. There are wonderful things we can do with financial donations, and that is crucial—but I want to focus on what we can do with our kids that uses tech's power — and costs no money.  One thing we can do is support businesses or social causes through tech with acts such as posting reviews on Yelp, giving stars and sharing recommendations. Having moved back recently to Seattle, I was so happy to see that the little café down the street from me, Fat Ducks, is still going strong. The owner is an incredible baker, and she is always working so hard to make everyone’s cafe experience enjoyable. It felt great to share her cafe with others online by giving her and her cafe a good review on Yelp. I made sure to include specific reasons why I like it so much because I know I like examples when I look at reviews. I did not expect it, but one day when I stopped in for some outstanding carrot cake, the owner thanked me for posting a review. I also love sharing links to friends’ work, such as their online talks, published books and articles.   I remind myself to involve my kids in these tiny acts. For example, if we go to a local Vietnamese Pho cafe, I will say, “Hey let's do a rating on this.”  When they read books they like, we talk about how writing a review can help the author’s work be appreciated by more readers.  My family tries to spread the word about organizations we love via social media and, of course, in face-to-face conversations.   What organizations do you love?  For this TTT, here are some questions to start a conversation:  · What are ways you perform small acts of kindness online towards people, businesses, etc. that you appreciate?  · Do you think liking a photo is a small act of kindness?  · What are causes and organizations that inspire you?  · In what ways do you contribute to your community and causes you care about?    ______________________  If you would rather not receive future communications from SCREENAGERS, please go to https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/wf/click?upn=0jpVdUjq4pKnFqr34rWqKKGkHD-2Bg5902lbRFo5HyB99-2FOFtKa8JtkDXqAzYpBcdSQeIfwTI5UiFzIA3vu0hRi8vPwMsw3BGsZHQ9FuKqVIsy5C9RPJ1WAl5LF5bsLSw1lUSBaMssDtmIXmVtT8liDwbwe6wSAuZdwBcdEmCQHXA-3D_6pchHAirW10eM8b14ZAlkZkRllITHdt0G4CIxpgEX-2FYMT-2FVtvkhkoxOwXdc140hQDKip1v9w6NG6f4yMNdzd3I0JbBoOspHl9BOjIgd0xs0ONb1SFdGQ9PKNQR-2B17gUhfkJ2HUrnk4ipXp1afMZgQwYuCgUNipZbOO4oiaxY7xnqQxvw9TeIU3bJOejPwVE7Fz4ybZByATthnFZYqVezH4RJvz01heBopEsFwKV143zsejBOZZp4xZDMcJzZ-2Fhd69Bh383KoilXJFJYqmYD87rZWAs3l3Xnu11oa8LwsP6B-2BJy9gITo6ZxDlVYkT54EEb6tM6GUu-2Fm6JymhQEXD-2B-2BRsLOeLnbe5bMobqqGDR7Hk-3D  SCREENAGERS, 735 Center Blvd Suite C, Fairfax, CA 94930 United States  --  To unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to customerservice+unsubscribe@csps.com.",8/6/2019 0:00,,,,,,FALSE,

The answer is disease. Right now 1-in-3 Americans either have type 2 diabetes or are in a state of pre-diabetes and it is on track to be a $1 trillion annual industry by 2026. Sobering statistics but there is a light at the end of that tunnel: type 2 diabetes is completely reversible AND curable and doing so can increase life expectancy by 50%.

The book gives readers the steps to take to reverse and cure the disease including a procedure many of us consider a ""shame"" surgery for the particularly lazy without ever realizing that it is, in fact, a lifesaver. I'd like to send a copy of the book in hopes you'll consider covering it on your blog.

The goal of the experts around the globe is to cure the type 2 diabetes outright – not settle for managing a number – and metabolic surgery combined with regular exercise does just that. The safe, 45-minute procedure with 4 Band-aids is quietly transforming the landscape of diabetes care, curing people of type 2 diabetes with a safer approach than pharmaceuticals.  This book will help you move from managing the serum glucose to reversing the type 2 diabetes and living a longer, healthier life.

And merely observing this type of violence or participating in duck-and-cover active shooter drills at school can, in turn, leave a powerful psychic imprint on children: witnessing or experiencing violence causes significant stress, which in turn can lead to violent behavior.  This trickles out into society as a whole.

The antidote, she explains, is to take concrete steps to end domination and violence at home and in society at large, beginning with a focus on parent-child and gender relations, so that we can weave non-violent behavior patterns into our individual and social fabric over time.

5000g000028b4VqAAI,Editorial comments and corrections,"The following information was collected:  Name: John  Email: robledoint@yahoo.com  Subscriber: No  Subject: Ohio Shooter reportedly supported Elizabeth Warren, Self- identified as ""Lefist""  Product: csmonitor.com  Message: Ohio shooter reportedly supported Elizabeth Warren, self-identified as ‘leftist’ August 5, 2019 by Patriot News Alerts Democrats are doing their best to blame their opponents for the horrific violence of the last week.  However, you can’t run from reality. The revelation that the Dayton shooter was a socialist who supported Elizabeth Warren for president has sent Dems into a panic.  Social media profile The insights into the politics of the shooter come from his social media. He identified his preferred pronouns as he/him. The 24-year-old also prominently displayed on his twitter that he was a “leftist.”  Connor Betts described himself as a pro-Satan leftist who hates Joe Biden’s generation, President Trump, and law enforcement.  Twitter has since suspended his account, but not before many of his tweets were recorded. Betts said in a tweet: “I want socialism, and I’ll not wait for the idiots to finally come round to understanding.”  It cannot be denied that he had a leftist worldview and goal. Other tweets made this clear: “Vote blue for [G]od’s sake,” “F*** John McCain.”  This contrasts heavily to the white supremacist shooter in El Paso, Texas, proving that senseless violence is not a partisan issue.  Culture needs reform As much as Democrats have attempted to pin the blame on Donald Trump, he isn’t responsible for the El Paso shooter. Conversely, Elizabeth Warren is also not responsible for the Dayton shooter.  Guns also cannot be blamed for the recent rise in mass shootings. We have always had guns. In fact, the further you go back in American history, the more guns the American people have typically had.  We live in a culture that encourages angry, emotionally immature people to act out. Kids grow up in a public school system where they are at best ignored, and at worst, drugged and mercilessly bullied.  Nihilism runs rampant and our children are taught that life is meaningless. Mental health resources are few and far between.  Until we change our culture, violence will only grow worse. As political division intensifies, mass shootings will just be another outlet for misdirected anger.",8/6/2019 0:00,CSM,CSM.com,Junk,,,FALSE,

Throughout her nearly 40-year career, Milano has used her platform to advance causes that matter deeply to her.  As a teenager, she helped to destigmatize and reduce the irrational fears surrounding HIV/AIDS by kissing Ryan White on national television. Her advancement of #MeToo sparked a viral movement of women fighting against sexual harassment and assault and she has been involved in TimesUp since its inception.  She recently joined the ERA Coalition’s Advisory Council. She is also the ACLU’s Ambassador for Reproductive Rights. In the wake of the mass shooting at Stoneman Douglas High School, Alyssa became one of the founders of NoRA, a coalition dedicated to combatting the NRA money in political campaigns so that common sense gun reform can be enacted. For 15 years, she has been a UNICEF National Ambassador.  In 2016, she received their Spirit of Compassion Award for her dedication to their mission of advocating for the protection of children's rights, helping meet their basic needs and expanding their opportunities to reach their full potential. She has lobbied members of congress for greater rights for immigrants as well as education reform and has been on the forefront of efforts to protect health coverage for all Americans.  She continues to use her voice and platform to advocate for social justice, fairness and equality. “Sorry Not Sorry,” is a natural outgrowth of her passion for so many important causes.

5000g000028b0U3AAI,Williamson Says We Need to Pray and Act,"View this email in your browser (https://mailchi.mp/marianne2020/p_a_100_8_5_19-245973?e=86750cd953) https://www.marianne2020.com/ FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE August 5, 2019 Patricia Ewing Communications Director Press@marianne2020.com (mailto:Press@marianne2020.com) 443-906-1495   Williamson Says We Need to Pray and Act Will Take Action in First Hundred Days   Democratic Presidential candidate Marianne Williamson said that ""We need to say prayers for the people of El Paso, Dayton, and Chicago in this agonizing moment. And prayers for all the rest of us as well, that we might summon the courage to remove this scourge of gun violence from our midst."" She said, “Let us pray and let us act.”  Williamson promised action, “As a candidate for the Democratic nomination for president, I hereby pledge to introduce, within the first 100 days of my presidency, comprehensive firearm legislation to establish universal background checks, outlawing of bump stocks, closing of gun show and boyfriend loopholes, plus outlawing of assault weapons as well as the bullets needed to shoot them.”  When Williamson was asked about this subject in last Tuesday's debate, she said, ""The issue of gun safety, of course, is that the NRA has us in a chokehold. But so do the pharmaceutical companies, the health insurance companies, the fossil fuel companies, and the defense contractors. None of this will change until we either pass a constitutional amendment or legislation that establishes public funding for federal campaigns.""  Williamson said that at a certain point in life, ""It isn’t about what happened; it’s about who we choose to be in response to what happened. Each of us must rise to the occasion now, committing to the electoral defeat of any politician who supports the NRA's political agenda. Gun safety legislation must be the cry of our generation. I applaud the Senators who have called upon Mitch McConnell to call the Senate into session to act on Gun Safety legislation.”  “America can either behave responsibly towards our common good, or we can acquiesce to the economic tyranny of gun manufacturers. We cannot do both,” emphasized Williamson.  Williamson gun safety plans can be found here. (https://www.marianne2020.com/issues/gun-control)  Williamson supports: * Eliminating the sale of assault rifles and semi-automatic weapons * Banning bump stocks and high capacity magazines * Strict control of gun use among children and access to guns among children * Required universal background checks, including at gun shows * Mandatory waiting periods for all gun dealers, including gun shows and sporting retailers * Reinstatement of Obama era restrictions on the ability of the mentally ill to purchase a gun * Child safety locks on all guns * Passage of Extreme Risk Protection Order Laws nationwide, allowing family members and law enforcement to seek court permission to temporarily remove guns from a person in danger of harming himself or others * Removing current limits on the Center for Disease Control’s (CDC) ability to track and record gun ownership numbers in America (vital information which helps in researching the overwhelming amount of gun deaths and underlying causes)  ###  ============================================================ ** (https://twitter.com/marwilliamson) ** (https://www.facebook.com/williamsonmarianne/) ** (https://www.instagram.com/mariannewilliamson/) ** (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXAMXGAP0YnBxtc8brSSbjg) ** (https://www.marianne2020.com) Copyright © 2019 Marianne Williamson for President, All rights reserved.

Firstly to    104 Palace Gardens Terrace   9 FTQ per month   PObox Blackheath Society   5 per month.   Blackheath still appear to be receiving  6 per month and this was changed three to four months ago but 104 Palace G Terrace received 8 instead of nine.   So in my phone call I asked to be credited for one re POBox address and you are sending a single copy of the Sept one to Palace G Terrace but this is all very time consuming and not helpful re mix up.

5000g000028b1QHAAY,Donation For Your Church,"Hello & Greetings,     My name is Henri Prillerman and I am a Program Coordinator for The Child Safety Matters http://www.thechildsafetymatters.com. <http://www.thechildsafetymatters.com.%20>   Our organization donates free child safety kits to schools, churches, and day care centers.  We would like to donate these complimentary child safety kits to the families whose children attend  Christian Science Reading Room .  There is absolutely no cost to you.  We will typically have a local Pediatrician, Dentist, or other community-minded business sponsor the cost of the kits, but for your organization, there will be absolutely no cost at all.     The child safety kits include the following items:     -A fingerprint chart with a safe, non-toxic ink strip  - Instructions for obtaining a DNA hair sample with a heavy gauge storage bag  - Two Safe Shoes Child IDÔ labels  - Two pages of comprehensive safety tips  - A chart to denote any unique physical features  - Forms for parents to document their child’s personal and medical information including their birth date, height, weight, hair and eye color, blood type, allergies and medications  - A dental chart for primary and secondary teeth.     SAMPLE OF KIT CONTENTS:  CLICK HERE <https://drive.google.com/open?id=1El6tn7qLffAf1QiZ0mR9J0yAsn1nCrJ3>      The child safety kits that we will provide to you are widely considered to be the highest quality child safety kits that are available in the United States.  These kits are presently used by thousands of Law Enforcement and Government Agencies throughout the country, including the NYPD, the US National Coast Guard, and the Utah Bureau of Criminal Investigation.     Our child safety kits allow parents to record important information about their child and provide potentially life-saving talking points, which foster meaningful safety discussions between parents and children.     We would like to provide you with enough kits for all of the children that attend your location, as well as your staff’s children, and the non-attending siblings of children who are enrolled at your location. Please provide me with the quantity of kits that we can send to you, at no cost to your location, as well as the best address where we can ship the kits.  Also, please just specify a contact person whom we can ship the kits to the attention of.

Let’s get the day started and have some fun!                         JOLLY!          Full of happiness and delight! Come on, let’s go play!                         WINKY!        Feelin’ mischievous? Or playful? Let’s stir the pot a little!                          GRUMPY!      Grrr! Not feeling it today – goin’ back to bed!                         GOOFY!        Seriously? Let’s do something silly today! Who’s with me?                         HAPPY!        Content as can be. Feelin’ good and full of positive energy.  And to make SMILE! SOX^™ all the more fun, kids and tweens can mix and match SOX by wearing two expressions at the same time! What’s more, since Tween & Women’s size SOX can fit most adult women, Moms can enjoy SMILE! SOX^™ alongside their kids and share a few family smiles together.  COMING SOON! Late summer will also see the introduction of SCARY! SOX^™ in advance of Halloween!  Give The Gift Of Smiles!                                                                                                                                                                                                        Tired of giving or receiving kids’ party favors that are tossed away within days or even hours? SMILE! SOX^™ are a fun, practical and cost-effective gift to offer guests during birthday celebrations.  SMILE! SOX^™are also ideal gifts to mail to out-of-town family members and friends with kids, to give as get well presents, to surprise your children with during back-to-school time and – in a few short months – to wrap up as holiday presents.  Quite A Feat!                                                                                                                                                              Based in Southern California, SMILE! SOX™ is independently owned and part of the Keepers International family. Founded in 1954, Keepers is a pioneering wholesale distributor of premium-quality, high-fashion socks that began by serving independent apparel and shoe stores along with larger regional department and sporting goods stores located on the West Coast. Today Keepers’ socks are sold in Dress, Casual, and Sport styles for men, women and kids at stores all around the world.    Commenting on the launch of the new SMILE! SOX^™ brand, Paul Hockley, President of Keepers International, said, “For more than 65 years we’ve dressed your feet with fashion, comfort and function but we wanted to do something more – something FUN. That’s where the idea of SMILE! SOX^™ was born. Why not make socks that bring joy to people and inspire happiness?

5000g000028beUQAAY,Re: Shipping Confirmation jshonline,"Dear Friends,  Reading Room : First Church, Hoylake Merseyside, Acct no82552   As you cansee from the email below, our Reading Room has a jshonline subscription for RRuse. Last year when we first purchased it we were told by CSPS that we couldnot pay for it as a rolling subscription monthly on our RR account  as we had a debit not credit card andso we would have to buy the ‘card’ that is mailed to us and activated with a code.But this would be for a max 12 months at a time.  We did this at the stated cost of $360 and thecard for activation arrived with no additional customs costs incurred.   When we cameto renew it this year, using the same method as last year, the UK postalservice (GPO) tried to deliver the card sent by you- as your email below- to myaddress (mailing address for all our RR purchases) when I was away. I returned tofind a  GPO notification that the ‘card’was being held by them as I had to pay a £66 customs fee and an £8 Post Officefee for handling the customs matter. If I did not collect by a certain datethen it would be returned to USA. That date had expired whilst I was away. Theitem had shown up on our monthly Reading Room statement though ($360).   So, I rang CSPS on 6th June 2019. Iexplained all this and was told that you had it on your system as awaitingdelivery due to outstanding customs payment from our end. You agreed that itwould be returned to your warehouse soon as undelivered. In the conversation yourrepresentative agreed that she thought no customs duty should be due for it.  I then queried again (as I had last year) whywe could not use our bank debit card as we do use it each month to pay theReading Room account to you. Your representative was very helpful and said thata debit card can usually be used like a credit card for payments to CSPS if ithas a VISA/Mastercard logo on it and our bank has authorised its use for thatpurpose. Your rep. logged our discussion and suggested that I try andre-subscribe using the church debit card and that we would then be charged asecond time but as a monthly rolling $30.  She agreed that if this worked OK then youwould see this on the account and remove the first requested payment of $360once the activation card had been returned back to your warehouse.   Having checked with our Church Treasurer, Ifound that our Church debit card was VISA and so I tried and used itsuccessfully to open a rolling subscription to jshonline and our RR laptop has loggedinto our RR jshonline account just fine.   Since then we have been paying the monthly $30on our  RR account with you as we expectedto do. However, the $360 lump sum charged for the activation card is stillappearing on our monthly statement. Please confirm that this should now beremoved from the statement as we never received the activation card and are nowpaying for the subscription on the monthly basis.

This dataset analyzes a shortlist of 40 U.S. cities and 23 more locations abroad, and is for immediate release. If you have any questions, or would like an exclusive quote, interview, or access to more data, please do not hesitate to contact me. If you think this index would be of interest to a peer, please feel free to pass on my message.Thanks very much,Kind regards, Ricky SuttonPress Relations Manager______________Sweet Spot PRw: sweetspotpr.com  e: ricky@sweetspotpr.com If you do not wish to receive future communications from Sweet Spot PR, please let us know by clicking here.KisiFor immediate releaseBest U.S. Cities for Work-Life Balance 2019 By comparing data on work intensity, institutional support, legislation, and livability, study reveals a ranking of cities based on their success in promoting work-life balance to their citizens.San Diego, Portland, and San Francisco top the index as the cities promoting the most holistic work-life balance in the U.S., compared to the most overworked cities in the U.S. study, Washington D.C., Houston, and Atlanta.On average, employees in Barcelona (30.5 days) and Paris (30 days) take advantage of the most amount of vacation days offered per year, whereas residents in San Francisco (9.7 days), San Diego (9.7 days), Washington D.C. (9.4 days), and Los Angeles (9.1 days) take the least.Boston, United States ranks #7 out of 40 for work-life balance worldwide.Brooklyn, NY, USA, August, 2019—Mobile access technology company Kisi has released a study examining which cities around the world promote the most holistic work-life balance. With the goal of enhancing an individual's personal and professional life through technological innovation, Kisi has endeavored to find out which coveted metropolises worldwide are meeting their residents’ lifestyle demands to make their city a more attractive place overall to work and live. In response to research on office culture, which addresses the needs of the modern employee, this study aims to go beyond generic metrics such as cost of living, nightlife and tourist attractions. Using data relating to work intensity, social well-being, and livability to analyze the interplay between work and life, the index assesses how successful residents are in achieving a healthy work-life balance in the U.S. and around the world.This index is not designed to be a city livability index, nor is it intended to highlight the best cities to work in. Instead, it aims to be a guideline for cities to benchmark their ability to support the fulfillment of residents’ lives by improving the aspects of life that help relieve work-related stress and intensity. With an ever-increasing burnout rate worldwide, self-care and time management are becoming higher priorities. This study was conducted in the hope that it will bring awareness to the multiple ways in which cities and countries can contribute to the overall happiness and well-being of the workforce.

It was a gigantic cockup as most of those events were.  And the generation that grew up in the 1960s has a lot to answer for.  Some examples:  The Clintons (both Bill and Hillary) and the Obamas (both Barack and Michelle) with their disastrous presidency.   The generation that got degrees in the 1960s went on to take over the faculties of our universities and proceeded to ruin said universities.  It might take two or three generations for the surviving ones, after the inevitable bankruptcies of many, to revive real education at those universities.  So far, my children seem to have avoided the moral bankruptcy the 1960s, for which I'd like to take credit but won't as my children (5) were and are a very independent bunch of individuals.  As for my grandchildren, most are too young now to know how they will turn out but since my children seemed to have avoided it maybe they'll communicate that to their children. As for myself, having been graduated from high school in 1957, I was too busy working seven days a week and going to college four nights a week to participate in what I regard as the colossal stupidities of most of my generation.  So, please.  Don't tell me about the changes that generation foisted up our nation.  We are still paying the price.  I still hope that one of these days the nation as a whole will wake up and return to the moral base our founding fathers endowed us with. If you desire any more feedback, you have my email.

It was a no-brainer. Technology is changing childhood and it’s affecting children, all over the world, across socio-economic status, race and religion.  Our kids are on the front lines of a digital revolution. Common Sense is a national nonprofit organization that is devoted to the well-being of children and families as technology permeates and influences virtually every aspect of their lives. From the simplest social interactions to long-term mental health.  We rate media, educate and advocate for children, and we have an independent research arm that helps frame the public dialogue around all the pressing issues that stem from kids growing up in a digital world. While we’re 15 years old, our mission to ensure the digital well-being of children is more relevant and vital than ever.  Why is it important to have a presence in New York state, and in New York City specifically?  San Francisco is the global headquarters for Common Sense, but we have offices across the country. New York is one of the the media and financial capitals of the world and where many of the decisions are made that affect our work. It’s important to find new business and philanthropic partners to support the digital well-being of kids and families.  As the New York director, I work with schools and give ""Parent Talks"" around our research. I speak to many of the issues that parents and educators face, be it screens and sleep, gaming, screen time, social media and mental health. Our research findings are continually updated with thorough, independent research. We need to keep conducting this research and provide facts to parents, educators, policy makers, business leaders and the tech industry.  As a mother yourself, why is the work of Common Sense important?  I am a parent first. With a teen, tween and one young child, I see the perils of technology—and some of the benefits too. We need to empower parents and educators as the acceleration of technology is changing childhood.  We say ""sanity, not censorship"" when it comes to the use of technology. We produce many in-depth, independent reports on gaming, teens and social media use, and now a groundbreaking report on sleep and screens. Technology is here to stay, and we can all use our Common Sense guidelines to manage the relationship our kids have with it so that they can benefit from it.  I live this every day, and I turn to our advice columns with questions all the time, even though I work here. The challenges are real, and parents, educators, the tech industry, business leaders and policy makers all have to be part of the solutions.   With everything that Common Sense does, what are you most focused on at this time in your role in the state of New York?  Every day is different. I may moderate or speak on a panel about mental health and teens, or speak to parents in schools. I plan events, like our Common Sense Awards, this year honoring Michael Bloomberg and Sesame Street at The Shed.  Parents, teachers, the media and even leaders of tech companies are expressing concerns about the role of technology on the social and emotional well-being of young people. So I am focused on empowering everyone to take charge.   What message do you most want to get to parents, educators and all those who care about the well-being of kids?  We have more power than we think. Today's children are tomorrow's leaders, work force and the foundation of society. We cannot ignore them and we cannot say it is all bad news.  We have to work at a parent level, school level and business and policy level. We have to engage everyone to make sure that we are taking care of the digital well-being of the youngest members of society. This is not just a problem in the U.S. When I speak to friends in India, the Middle East, the U.K, you name it, parents are all facing similar issues.  As personal devices and tech create barriers and compete for our attention, parents can use our guidelines and educators can look at our free K-12 Digital Citizenship Curriculum to help.   What do you think is the news media’s role in this work?  The news media can help by making this part of the national dialogue. We are conducting a real time experiment on our youngest minds, and let’s not forget that this is the most tracked generation. I haven't even started on our privacy work yet, with Common Sense's Kids Action to create laws to protect the interests of our children.  We also want to make sure children are getting the right information from recognized news media. We live in an age of misinformation and children need to be critical thinkers. Children are being bombarded by all kinds of information, but they need to learn how to evaluate it. They are going to go out and vote, and make life-changing decisions and choices, and we need to make sure they have accurate information to guide them. We know that the way young people receive their news is from friends, family and social media. The time to intervene is now.

At that time, arms consisted of flint lock rifles and pistols, canons, swords and bayonets. The flint lock guns and rifles were single shot and would take a minute or two to reload. We had thirteen states that were sparsely populated with a lot of distance between neighbors. Our army consisted of local militias that were not very well trained. Police forces were rare and not sophisticated. Residents might have to defend themselves from robbery or savages.  Today, none of that exists. We have sophisticated armed forces and police departments. We don't have to worry about savages. We might want a hand gun for defense against a criminal. We might want a rifle for hunting. Do we need an assault rifle for any of these purposes? Do you think the writers of the 2nd amendment would include assault rifles if they were writing it today?  Assault rifles are weapons of war and are designed for one purpose only and that is to kill people, lots of people very quickly. Assault rifles should not be legal for general public but only for our military.",8/8/2019 0:00,CSM,CSM.com,Editorial,,,FALSE,

Dear friends:  This attitude is bizarre; what is the logic behind it?  Is it saying Democrats think Trump is too rich?  Certainly his brashness does not reflect favorably, or imply supremacy....  Is it claiming people ""of color"" are worse off now than they were three years ago?  You quote it without comment; do you regard Trump as a white supremacist, or do you regard Democrats as obviously off the wall, or do you think the statement is worth considering as fact....?  ----------------------   ""Top-down decrees begin with bottom-up education.""  A comment:  In the rape discussion, I felt the need to suggest you watch out for wording  ""double entendre"", etc.....  consider that the use of ""top down"" laws, etc., is followed by ""bottom"" which is an unfortunate word to use in a discussion about rape.....  some might laugh, i suppose; surely there's a better wording...?

5000g000028bFw4AAE,Story angle : Alcohol helps sleep? Eating spiders as we sleep?,"Stephanie,Americans are more likely than others international to believe that alcohol before bed helps you sleep - so says an international poll on popular sleep myths.https://www.calm.com/blog/most-widely-held-sleep-myths-poll-ranks-top-10They are far more likely to do so than either the British or French, according to the survey of 4,337 American, British and French adults, conducted by pollsters YouGov on behalf of Calm, the sleep and meditation app.22% of Americans believe that pre-bed alcohol aids sleep, compared to just 10% of French and 17% of British respondents – and 17% of respondents overall. &nbsp;Although folklore – and almost a quarter of Americans – holds that a “nightcap” is a useful sleep aid, science disagrees.""While alcohol may calm you and speed the onset of sleep, it actually increases the number of times you awaken during the night,” says the National Sleep Foundation.On a more positive note -- Americans are LESS likely than others to believe that “You swallow a few spiders every year while you sleep”One in four (25%) Americans believe that we eat spiders while we sleep, finds Calm’s poll, compared to 32% of both French and British and 30% of respondents overall.Whatever the truth of this theory – which itself seems to lack evidence – some adherents to the spider-swallowing myth will even quote you precise numbers: that we swallow seven (or is it eight?) spiders a year (or is it a lifetime?).And whatever the original source of the notion, it is, of course, not true. A sleeping person is more likely to scare off a nearby spider than ingest one.10 common sleep myths are ranked in a survey of 4,337 American, British and French adults – conducted by Calm, the sleep and meditation app.https://www.calm.com/blog/most-widely-held-sleep-myths-poll-ranks-top-10https://calm.com/blog/the-10-most-widely-held-myths-and-why-theyre-wrong""There are so many common myths about sleep that we wanted to find out which ones are, in fact, most widely believed,"" says Michael Acton Smith, co-founder of Calm.""Some sleep myths are fairly harmless, while others are seriously dangerous,"" says Alex Tew, co-founder of Calm.Can I arrange an interview or help in any way further here?Todd Brabender785.842.8909** If this topic isn't of interest simply reply with the word NO in the subject line.I look forward to working with you soon on other topics of interest to you.If you'd rather not get any future email pitches, press releases or story ideas from us, please type remove in the subject line and we won't contact you on any topic further moving forward.

5000g000028bgCkAAI,,"The US government and the Chinese government cannot pretend to be in contact with each other. I don't know how many transactions in China have made the US government aware of the immoral relationship between China and the United States. According to the 1987 US government and the Chinese government. How to bully, as a country should have principles, but the US government has never had any principle of communicating with China. In 1984, the Texas Laboratory of the United States gave birth to a child in Luoyang, China. The US government works with Luoyang City, Hong Kong and China. The US government asked me to return to Luoyang, China to continue. The Chinese government's laboratories are described by the US government as laboratories in Afghanistan. In 1987, I shot and killed me in Luoyang, China. This is the cooperation between the US government and the Chinese government. In my opinion, the US government and the Chinese government changed the murder case to Laos and changed it to Myanmar. The US government-managed laboratories showed a very clear relationship in 1987. They conducted diplomatic exchanges in accordance with US diplomatic international standards. These small countries are willing to maintain friendly relations with the United States. The US international diplomacy standard was the standard for establishing internationalization of US diplomacy in 1987. In 1987, American laboratory staff were not Chinese laboratory staff. The United States is the promoter of international standardization of world diplomacy, and the country is not willing to be overwhelmed by hegemonic bullying.  --  To unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to customerservice+unsubscribe@csps.com.",8/11/2019 0:00,,,Junk,,,FALSE,

Substitute the word “Nazi” for the word “racist” in the article and I wonder if your writers would have treated the “red staters” with such fawning gentility and adoring awe. I should point out that the plurality of voting Republicans believe racism is real and morally unacceptable. Your writers don’t seem to want to recognize that fact.

This is Deborah. I wanted to touch base with you after a tumultuous few days.  Bill's appearance on the Ingraham Angle on Monday night had to be postponed for personal reasons. Fortunately, they were able to reschedule him for tonight (Tuesday). So don't forget to tune into Fox News tonight at 10pm (EDT). He'll be talking about his CNN interview (among other things). It's very exciting!  After the horrifying events in El Paso and Dayton, I've been troubled by some of the things I've seen on social media, from ""talking heads,"" and even from some Democratic candidates  Like so many of you, I'm saddened by the loss of innocent life. I wish I had the answers that would put an end to such violence - how to stop the hate, how to heal the troubled minds behind these acts.  What I don't like is the blame game. We didn't blame President Obama for the massacre at Sandy Hook or President Clinton for the Columbine killings. We should not be using these tragedies to point fingers or advance a political agenda. Sometimes I wonder if there are groups who have press releases already filled out, just waiting to fill in the names of the next tragedy so they can score their political points.  What we should be doing is mourning and uniting in a time of sorrow. We should be doing some soul searching. We should be listening to each other, not shouting at one another.  We have so many freedoms in America, but sometimes we take advantage of the wrong ones. We speak, but we don't hear. We value press over respect for others and even the truth. We confuse the difference between freedom of religion and try to make it freedom ""from"" religion.  I am so tired of seeing people leap to turn tragedy into a political weapon. I can't speak for others, but personally, I'll be tuning out the noise from the media and politicians and looking for ways I can spread unity in my own community.  For faith, family and freedom, Dr. Deborah Owens  P.S. Your prayers and financial support will help us put this country on the right path.

5000g000028bAs4AAE,"talk to ""smart people"" about God","Dear Editors,   After reading “How can I talk to ‘smart people’ about God?” in the August issue of the Journal, I wanted to add my own answer to the question.  I hope you don’t mind!   Q: How can I talk to my friends about God and Christian Science when they say intelligent people are too smart to have faith or believe in a higher power?   A:  With respect, humilty, and fearlessness!  Why fearlessness?  Because the question implies that atheism has a reason to feel smug, while thought accustomed to turning to God is on the defensive.  Right from the start, we don’t want to buy into that notion.  We do have something precious to share, something that humanity is deeply yearning for.   Actually, the fact is quite the opposite of that premise.  Intelligent people are too smart to be ignorant of the source of all being, and the true nature of reality.  Stated in human terms, they are too smart to believe that they already have everything all figured out, and whatever does not fit their rigid conception of reality is worthy of scorn.  That is decidedly not a scientific frame of mind!   Since evolution regards random occurences as the driver of the development of all forms of life, I like to think of atheism as faith in chance, whereas acknowledging God as Creator is faith in intelligence.  Most intelligent people would not choose to place their trust in chance over intelligence.  We can marvel at what people are willing to believe chance is capable of creating!   One of the most arresting statements I know of — and a perfect pivot for this kind of conversation — is from Science and Health, p. 313:  “Jesus of Nazareth was the most scientific man that ever trod the globe. He plunged beneath the material surface of things, and found the spiritual cause.”   And how do you know that all the works attributed to Jesus are not simple legend or pure fabrication?  Why, from your own life, and the experiences of your family members and fellow church members, of course!  You know because you have found you can turn to this Science in every situation for consistent healing results.  Sharing some of those healings with your friends, as well as the fact that you trust your health to this scientific practice, clearly shows that for you, religion is not dogma and ritual — which is generally how non-religious people view religion.   Here, the laws of aerodynamics provide a useful example.  Before these laws were understood, maybe the idea of a hot air balloon, or a light-weight glider, would be acceptable.  But a jumbo jet?  A flying machine weighing hundreds of tons, capable of carrying hundreds of people and delivering them safely to distant destinations?  What intelligent person could possibly believe such a preposterous notion as that?  Yet, an idea that would have been ridiculed and scorned has now become universally accepted, simply because the laws behind it have been understood and demonstrated.  And we feel we can trust our lives safely to an all-good God, because we are learning to understand and demonstrate His laws.    ?Sincerely,  Robin Smith  303-815-2248 3076 S Grape Way Denver, CO 80222",8/6/2019 0:00,JSH,Journal,Feedback - Positive,,,FALSE,

5000g000028bKhTAAU,Re: Why El Paso is determined not to roll up the welcome mat,"Listening for the voice of Love, not hate I believe that we as a people are love.  That love is our deepest truth and truest part of our being.  I also believe that God's gift of free will is the source of our greatest triumphs and deepest despair.  It means to me that our current troubles will end when we have had enough of fear and hate.  When we realize that we have gone too far down a dark road and must return to our true self.  It our job to show those around us what love is.  Love is not responding to hate with more hate, yet neither is it sitting passively by waiting for a decree from the Almighty.  It is working to change the situations that are fueling the hate, it is showing the world that love is not passive, love is involved in making the world better.  In my case it is working with my Buddhist Temple to feed the homeless here in San Diego.  It is also working with people to show that there are ways to address gun violence.  In short, it is getting involved to make my part of the world a kinder and gentler place.

Part of that comes from my co-writers, Luke Dick and Natalie Hemby, and the other part of that comes from spending time in New York City. Being there has put a new energy into my music and my writing.”  Her recently-released single “It All Comes Out in the Wash” set a career high upon its release to country radio on July 21, with 112 Billboard and Mediabase/Country Aircheck stations and SiriusXM The Highway onboard in its first week. Co-written by Lambert and The Love Junkies (Hillary Lindsey, Lori McKenna, Liz Rose), critics have praised the “infectious, tongue-in-cheek tune” (Billboard) as a “delightful, sprightly rocker” (Rolling Stone) and a “cute-as-hell country bop” (NPR). The Grammy Award winner also responded to fan demand by dropping “rockabilly banger” (Stereogum) “Locomotive,” which she recently performed on “CMA Fest” and co-wrote with Ashley Monroe and K.S. Rhoads.  “It All Comes Out in the Wash,” “Mess with My Head,” and “Locomotive” are available now on all streaming platforms and digital retailers (https://truepublicrelations.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=12625cf9000644aef0f718377&id=fc1bfe91f6&e=1acc59e421) .

National Honey Bee Day was started in 2009 by beekeepers to promote and educate the public about the bee industry, and Buzzagogo with Appalachian Headwaters are on a mission to support and train former coal miners to learn the art, science and business of earning a sustainable income through beekeeping.  “I started Cold Bee Gone in my home in a small town, so I understand how small businesses can directly affect smaller communities in positive ways. I also understand what it means when an industry that’s supporting an entire community goes under,” begins Joyce Dales, CEO and founder of Buzzagogo, LLC. “I’ve always been interested in getting involved in great causes, but Appalachian Headwaters is a bee-related organization that demonstrates measurable real-life results. The bee industry supports our ability to create our best-selling Cold Bee Gone remedy, and without that honey, I would never have been able to start my own company. This project directly helps the bee population and small, local economies, so aligning myself with them was a no-brainer.”  Joyce developed Cold Bee Gone to protect her daughter during her recovery from open heart surgery.  The product is a unique blend of homeopathic ingredients—a proprietary honey blend which includes Active Manuka honey and essential oils.

5000g000028bNWDAA2,6 Sources for Back-to-School Stories to Help Parents & Their Kids Succeed in September,"Hi Stephanie,  Reaching out to let you know I have clients available as sources for interviews around Back-to-School stories. Each has a different area of expertise to help children, teens/college students and even parents ease anxiety, face bullies, manage time, excel at learning and social situations, and transition into a successful school year. Please let me know if you are interested in speaking with any of them, learning more, or receiving a copy of their books.  Thanks in advance for your feedback and consideration.  Have a great day,  Joelle  ----  SOURCE: Heather Hansen (https://heatherhansenpresents.com/) , partner at O’Brien and Ryan law firm, anchor at the Law and Crime network, host of The Elegant Warrior podcast. Also has a psychology degree.  Book: The Elegant Warrior: How to Win Life’s Trials Without Losing Yourself  Topic: How students can advocate for themselves and how parents can help.  1. Parents of young children who are going to school and need to learn to advocate for themselves with other students and teachers: As your children head out for the new school year, they will face new challenges. They will need to learn to advocate for themselves effectively. You can help by teaching them the 4 Ps (pause, plan, practice, play).  2.  College students who need to advocate for themselves and stay safe.   As college students head out to their new lives without their parents, they will face new challenges. Some of those are hard, especially in the time of MeToo, frat hazing and social media bullying. Here are some ways they can advocate for themselves in tough situations, using the word DORM as guidance. Discover, Object, Recognize tone and body language, Move  3. Your Child Is Bullied—How to Advocate for Them (Like a Trial Lawyer). There’s very little research on the impact of bullying on parents. But the little we have shows us that parents are the “secondary victim” and Hansen’s advocacy tools can definitely help parents. One big factor is the relationship between parent and teacher and working to prevent animosity there. A good advocate needs to create allies and not enemies.   Links: Connect with Heather Hansen on Facebook @HeatherHansenPresents (https://www.facebook.com/heatherhansenpresents/) , Twitter @ImHeatherHansen (https://twitter.com/imheatherhansen) , Instagram @ImHeatherHansen (https://www.instagram.com/imheatherhansen/?hl=en) , LinkedIn @HeatherHansen (https://www.linkedin.com/in/heather-hansen-84243512/) , YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2ecu4d4mKYZuh9QE9ZWhmA) , and visit www.heatherhansenpresent.com (http://www.heatherhansenpresent.com) .  ------  SOURCE:  John J.

Book: Miracle Minded Manager: A Modern Day Parable about How to Apply A Course in Miracles in Business releases on October 22, 2019 in paperback and e-Book.  Topic: As September nears, so does fear and anxiety for parents who have to entrust the safety and well-being of their kids to schools. Murphy can share tips for parents to overcome a fear-based mindset, adopt a miracle-minded way of thinking, and find inner peace when faced with challenging situations: Let be, let go, let see, and let flow.  “People all over the world are stressed,” says Murphy. “More importantly, people are stressed and they are not aware it is a condition of their own making. The ego mindset is projecting a negative outcome or possibility onto the future and when we dwell on what could go wrong, we feel anxious and afraid. These negative assumptions, projected by the mind, are triggering fear and stress. It is like being nervous before giving a speech or taking an exam. We are nervous because we ‘think’ something might go wrong. Mindful parenting is essential to helping mothers and fathers see things differently - by teaching them to see in a different way, a miracle-minded way.”    Links: Connect with John J.

5000g000028bAN1AAM,"Interview Op with Theresa M. Robinson - Overcoming Gender Inequity: Real, Raw, Unapologetic Stories, Tips & Strategies","Dear Stephanie Hanes :  Women who feel overlooked and overjudged as a direct result of gender bias have been given a powerful voice in Theresa M. Robinson's latest release, Overcoming Gender Inequity: Real, Raw, Unapologetic Stories, Tips & Strategies.  Offering an array of immediate, short-term and long-term tactics that can be tailored to many situations, Overcoming Gender Inequity is a must-read for all women who are ready to make their voices heard.  I would be happy to send you a complimentary copy of this thought-provoking book in consideration of an interview, review or feature. Please read the following press release, and contact me to schedule an interview. I'd also be happy to send you JPEGs of Robinson and the book cover. Thank you.  Please see Robinson at youtube.com/channel/UCAEheaz_mUB-ii23hejC6KQ/videos.  Karen Anderson Ascot Media Group, Inc. Post Office Box 2394 Friendswood, TX 77549 news@ascotmedianews.com ascotmedia.com 281.333.3507 Phone 800.854.2207 Fax  (This press release may be reprinted in part or entirety by any print or broadcast media outlet, or used by any means of social media sharing)  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Overcoming Gender Inequity Gives Powerful Voice To The ""Herstory” Of Systemic Gender Bias   **Houston, TX, August 6, 2019** — Are you an OVERachiever who still makes less money than her male counterparts? Do men talk OVER you at work? Do you OVERcommit your time and energy and end up OVERwhelmed?  If your answers are ""yes,” you are not alone, and international speaker and corporate trainer Theresa M. Robinson has a name for this phenomenon: O-Syndrome.   While conducting research for her first book in this series, O-Syndrome: When Work is 24/7 and You're Not, Robinson observed a clear pattern that confirmed what she'd been hearing women tell her for years: gender issues were a major source of their stress.   ""Specifically, women were pointing to the impact of gender bias and gender inequity both inside and outside of the workplace,” Robinson explained. ""And adding to this, women of color were contextualizing the intersection of gender and race within their experiences.”   Her powerful follow-up, Overcoming Gender Inequity: Real, Raw, Unapologetic Stories, Tips & Strategies dives deeper into the unique experiences with O-Syndrome faced by a range of women from different industries, at various stages in their careers, and from diverse backgrounds with whom she conducted personal interviews. Robinson expertly — and with refreshing honesty — explores how the obstacles these women faced were informed by their shared experiences with systemic gender bias and discrimination.   ""As a facilitator/speaker interacting with audiences all over the world, I am naturally drawn to women and their experiences. Once I issued the formal call about this project, the responses were immediate. Accomplished, professional women were eager to talk more about what they've experienced and what they've learned,” Robinson added. ""They detailed the costs of being female in male-dominated environments.”  Overcoming Gender Inequity is divided into three parts: What We Face; What We Do to Ourselves; and What We Want from Allies, and shares stories that transcend title and industry; time and space; ethnicity and generation. Readers will glean valuable lessons from other women who've ""been there,” as they share their ""aha” moments, their insights, the raucous laughter, the frustrations, and yes, even the tears. This book is a must-read not only for women, but also for men who are ready to advocate for women both in and out of the workplace.   (Of note: The WarriHER's Playbook on Well-Being and Self-Advocacy, third in the series and the companion workbook to Overcoming Gender Inequity, will be released later this year and will contain activities and exercises for both individual and group use.)

Excerpts from Reviews:  Kelly Lockwood Primus, Senior Vice President, Leading Women, LLC —  ""Having been the only woman in the room for so many years, in so many companies, over the course of my career, it is my greatest hope that this book will provide guidance and strength to all women leaders….""  Shary Hauer, founder of The Hauer Group, executive advisory and coaching firm, and author of Insatiable: A Memoir of Love Addiction — ""What a gift Theresa gives us — the telling of shared experiences from wise and courageous sisters … It's from healing our most painful memories that we blossom into self-actualized women. The only antidote to O-Syndrome is to be O-mnipotent! Now is our time to rise to our unlimited power!”   Joan Toth, Senior Consultant, Diversity & Inclusion, Simpactful, and advisory board member, Gender Fair — ""Theresa tells it like it is — every woman will relate to O-Syndrome. Get ready to see yourself and your friends, mom, sisters and colleagues in her stories…”   Catherine Mackel, IT specialist, Federal Government — ""As I've maneuvered through the information technology field, I've encountered many 'good old boy' networks of men who discriminate at all levels. Through personal examples, Theresa exposes these behaviors. I found myself relating to the indignities. Yet, Theresa left me with an optimistic view for taking charge and overcoming my unfounded feelings of inadequacy.”  Margie Warrell, women's leadership coach, speaker and best-selling author of Stop Playing Safe — ""Can women get to the top like men? You bet we can. But let's face it, the climb is steeper and the juggling act that much harder. If you ever wonder if you've got what it takes to last the distance toward whatever ambitions inspire you, this book is for you.”   Possible discussion topics for Theresa M.

5000g000028bdigAAA,,"Respected Sir/Madam My name is Urooj Saraj, I am a born Christian and I belong to a Christian family. I born in Faisalabad (Pakistan), I used to go for tuition class in my area in a Muslim house, where I met Adnan, I was studying from Adnan sisters. Once Adnan proposed me for marriage but I refused because in Islamic Republic of Pakistan it not possible as I am I a Christian but he proposed me again and again for months and told me that he will accept Christianity and will be converted from Islam, so then I also agree to marry him, then we planned to go Rawal Pindi for marriage, Pastor Ilyas Masih performed our marriage. After marriage we returned back to Faisalabad to our homes, we were living separately, Adnan was living in his home and I was living in my home but after 2month we decided to live together as we were husband and wife. Adnan was working in a factory and with the help of his boss we got I house on rent near to his factory and stat living together, I was continuously living there and Adnan was spending much time there with me and rest he was staying in his house only, with his parents so that they don’t come to know about our marriage, Adnan father was thoughtful because most of the time after his job he was not returning at home back, so he went and asked Adnan's boss about it, he told him that Adnan got married and he is living in a house of rent with his wife. He came to know that he married me as he knows be from before that I am a Christian, he became very angry. One day I was alone at my home as Adnan was on job, somebody knocked the door I opened the door and saw Adnan parents and many other people were with them, they all beat me very badly as I was two months pregnant and because of that I had a miscarriage, they lifted me half dead and were gone, when Adnan was back he took me to hospital for treatment and we planned to run somewhere or else Muslim will kill us according to SHRIA law in Pakistan, mean that we have committed Blasphemy law and should be Killed. So we went to Sialkot to my brother house to safe our lives but my condition was very critical as i was badly beaten by them, so I went to hospital in Sialkot where I had breast operation, after some days my condition was bit stable and I was able to come back home from hospital but we heard that Muslims are in search of us to kill us, thank God that we met a Pastor in Sialkot who guided us to leave Pakistan or else Muslims will kill us, he gave us the suggestion to go Thailand and apply Asylum. Thanks God that we managed to come Thailand on 11th June 2013 and we applied for Refugee Status, after 2 years in 2015 we had our Refugee interview in UNHCR but unfortunately we got refused from UNHCR in 2017 because may be we were not able to explain them about our self. I had a Testimony also on YOUTUBE ,because of that Adnan lifted me and was gone and the video was viral everywhere and secondly we were refused from UNHCR ,Now I am alone with my two small children as I husband left me from two years, I am spending a very miserable life here as I am illegal staying here with our visa and because of that can’t work also anywhere to feed my children, police immigration is always in search to arrest people without visa to put them in jail, often I am not having money to pay my room rent and facing many problems like food, milk for children, medication etc. I request you to please help me to get out from this critical condition and will be able to live a freedom life in your country where I will be able to get job and my children will be able to go school and can have necessities of life. First of all I trust God and secondly I have hopes on you. May God bless you all, and keep you always happy.

5000g000028bdjAAAQ,Hudson Announces Launch of New Podcast and Media Fellows,"Listen to our new podcast: The Realignment  This week, we launched a new podcast called  The Realignment [https://www.hudson.org/research/15229-the-realignment-ep-1-j-d-vance], hosted by newly named Media Fellows Saagar Enjeti and Marshall Kosloff.  The United States is in the midst of a dramatic political realignment. Events such as the unexpected election of Donald Trump, populist revolts across Europe, and the arrival of an aggressive and unapologetic China have upended conventional wisdom. The Realignment is a weekly podcast that will explore these shifting norms in national security, economics, technology, and the role of government.  In Episode 1, Marshall and Saagar sat down with best-selling author of Hillbilly Elegy J.D. Vance. They discussed whether it was a mistake to let China into the World Trade Organization, how conservatives should approach the free market, what it means to be an American Nationalist in 2019, and his skepticism of the technology industry as a venture capitalist.  Click here to listen to the episode [https://www.hudson.org/research/15229-the-realignment-ep-1-j-d-vance].  “I think that we should consider China as our nation should have considered Nazi Germany in the mid-1930's. Only we should recognize that it’s more dangerous because it’s larger and it’s more ambitious. I think that Hitler wanted to rule Europe. I think that China wants to rule over a much larger share of the world—maybe the entire world.” – J.D. Vance ( The Realignment, Episode 1 [https://www.hudson.org/research/15229-the-realignment-ep-1-j-d-vance])  On Tuesday we’ll release Episode 2, featuring an in-depth discussion with conservative thinker and author George Will. The episode covers a wide range of issues including the role government should have in regulating technological advances, how to deal with the threat of a rising China, and whether the United States should pursue a manufacturing-based national economic strategy to confront it.  We hope you join us each week as Marshall and Saagar dive in to the most important issues facing our society today. Click the buttons below to listen and subscribe.

Confidence in democratic institutions and mainstream political parties is fast eroding, with people increasingly drawn towards the rhetoric of populist demagogues and authoritarian leaders. What are the roots of this revolt against liberalism and how can it be countered?  In this new book, the leading Green politician and thinker Ralf Fücks argues that the threat to liberal democracy lies within democracy itself. Democracy is the fundamental guarantor of freedom and it is our own failure to defend it that has led to the encroachment of an illiberal and divisive politics. In a powerful counter, Fücks outlines the foundations for an ambitious democratic renewal: greater investment in the public institutions to create a sense of belonging and political community; a focus on education as the key instrument for social advancement; the promotion of a democratic patriotism based on common political values; a better understanding of how to increase participation in the emerging digital economy; and sustainable innovation that will unleash the creative potential of liberal societies.  This robust defense of liberal democracy will be essential reading for anyone concerned about the very real threat faced by our democratic freedoms today and wondering what we can do about it.  The Author:  Ralf Fücks is Co-Founder of the Centre for Liberal Modernity, a non-partisan organization that stands up for the defense and renewal of open society and looks for answers to the key challenges of our time.  Formerly President of the Heinrich Böll Foundation, he was a leading figure in the German Green Party and Senator for Environment and Urban Development in Bremen.

5000g000028bFImAAM,"NEW CLIENT: BioCorRx – Offers Safe and Effective, Live-Saving Implants to Treat Those with Addiction Disorders","Hi Stephanie?,  I wanted to reach out and introduce you to a new client I’m representing, BioCorRx – a leading edge healthcare solutions company focused on improving the lives of those struggling with alcohol and opioid addiction.  BioCorRx has developed a sustained-release naltrexone implant which is used to inhibit cravings associated with the utilization of alcohol and opioids. Naltrexone has been approved for use as a tablet, to help thousands of patient fight their addictions, in the United States since 1984. While the drug is very effective to treat addiction, some physicians have observed that the recommended dosage form and efficacy of the drug can present obstacles that can affect the treatment process for addicts especially in the critical early stages. Medical experts have found that the use of a long-acting naltrexone implant presents a way to overcome the hurdles that may arise with the use of the commercially available dosage forms of the drug.  Image  To further discuss BioCorRx and the innovative naltrexone implant, CEO and Founder Brady Granier, is available to be interviewed.  Warmest,  Nandi  About BioCorRx:  BioCorRx Inc. (OTCQB: BICX) is an addiction treatment company offering a unique approach to the treatment of substance abuse addiction. The BioCorRx® Recovery Program, a non-addictive, medication-assisted treatment (MAT) program, consists of two main components. The first component of the program consists of an outpatient implant procedure performed by a licensed physician. The implant delivers the non-addictive medicine, naltrexone, an opioid antagonist that can significantly reduce physical cravings for alcohol and opioids, and can prevent opioid overdose following relapse. The second component of the program developed by BioCorRx Inc. is a Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) program tailored specifically for the treatment of alcoholism and other substance abuse addictions for those receiving long-term naltrexone treatment. The Company also conducts R&D under its controlled subsidiary, BioCorRx Pharmaceuticals.

This is Deborah. I wanted to touch base with you after a tumultuous few days.  Bill's appearance on the Ingraham Angle on Monday night had to be postponed for personal reasons. Fortunately, they were able to reschedule him for tonight (Tuesday). So don't forget to tune into Fox News tonight at 10pm (EDT). He'll be talking about his CNN interview (among other things). It's very exciting!  After the horrifying events in El Paso and Dayton, I've been troubled by some of the things I've seen on social media, from ""talking heads,"" and even from some Democratic candidates  Like so many of you, I'm saddened by the loss of innocent life. I wish I had the answers that would put an end to such violence - how to stop the hate, how to heal the troubled minds behind these acts.  What I don't like is the blame game. We didn't blame President Obama for the massacre at Sandy Hook or President Clinton for the Columbine killings. We should not be using these tragedies to point fingers or advance a political agenda. Sometimes I wonder if there are groups who have press releases already filled out, just waiting to fill in the names of the next tragedy so they can score their political points.  What we should be doing is mourning and uniting in a time of sorrow. We should be doing some soul searching. We should be listening to each other, not shouting at one another.  We have so many freedoms in America, but sometimes we take advantage of the wrong ones. We speak, but we don't hear. We value press over respect for others and even the truth. We confuse the difference between freedom of religion and try to make it freedom ""from"" religion.  I am so tired of seeing people leap to turn tragedy into a political weapon. I can't speak for others, but personally, I'll be tuning out the noise from the media and politicians and looking for ways I can spread unity in my own community.  For faith, family and freedom, Dr. Deborah Owens  P.S. Your prayers and financial support will help us put this country on the right path.

5000g000028bDegAAE,Expert Avail in Boston- How Students Can Advocate for Themselves,"Hi Stephanie,  Back to school might mean back to bullying, and other challenges for students of all ages.  Heather Hansen (https://heatherhansenpresents.com/) , partner at O’Brien and Ryan law firm, anchor at the Law and Crime network, host of The Elegant Warrior podcast and author of The Elegant Warrior: How to Win Life’s Trials Without Losing Yourself [Page Two, April 2019], is available for interviews to teach students how to advocate for themselves. She can address two audiences in particular:  1. Parents of young children who are going to school and need to learn to advocate for themselves with other students and teachers  2.  College students who need to advocate for themselves and stay safe.   Hansen’s advice for young children and parents of young children:  As your children head out for the new school year, they will face new challenges. They will need to learn to advocate for themselves effectively. You can help by teaching them the 4 Ps.   Pause—they don’t have to react right away. Most of the time if they are facing a bully or a “mean” teacher, there’s time to walk away and address it later.   Plan-then they can come home and plan for their advocacy. This is where questions come in. How could they handle the problem? What do they want to say? How do they want to say it?   Practice—playing it out with your children is a great way to make sure they are not only ready, but comfortable. I’d never step into trial without practicing, and your kids shouldn’t face their trials without practice either. (nor should adults!)  Play-when they get into the situation, all they have to do is “press play” on what they’ve prepped and practiced. They can go into the situation confident that they have the tools they need and that the conversation or interaction could even be fun!  This type of preparation also makes children much more likely to respond well when they don’t have time for the 4 Ps!  Hansen’s advice for college students:  As college students head out to their new lives without their parents, they will face new challenges. Some of those are hard, especially in the time of MeToo, frat hazing and social media bullying. Here are some ways they can advocate for themselves in tough situations, using the word DORM as guidance.   D-Discover. First, discover yourself. You can’t advocate for yourself until you know what you want and what you don’t want. Also this is the time to learn your limits with respect to drinking, relationships, and social media.   O-Object. You have to learn to object when you don’t like something. I was petrified the first time I objected in the courtroom. But no one can set your boundaries but you. When you know what you don’t want, it is time to use your voice and set those boundaries. Objections take practice so start small. Don’t be afraid to say “ I don’t like that”  R-Recognize tone and body language College kids need to know that bodies and voices can tell them as much as words do. Tone of voice is especially helpful, as studies show you can tell more about a person’s emotion from their tone of voice than their facial expressions. If they can read tone of voice, they may hear danger before they see it.   M-Move. When you feel uncomfortable, read a weird tone in a voice, don’t like someone’s body language, or don’t like the response to your objection, you can leave. Don’t be afraid to move your body. Sometimes confidence follows.   Are you interested in scheduling an interview or byline? I’m also happy to send a book your way.  More about Hansen is below.  Thanks in advance for your consideration and feedback.  Have a great day,  Joelle  HEATHER HANSEN is a trial lawyer, consultant and professional speaker.

And contrary to what we thought it would be like pre-GPDR, the response is a good one. Really good, actually.  GPDR all but forced adherence to best practices, which in turn, ensured that data was treated how it should be, with respect. But perhaps most importantly, it gave those with earned attention an even better chance at connecting with their subscribers.

5000g000028bEXHAA2,FEAT/INT: “Are You Raising a Liar? Key Warning Signs and What To Do About It”,"Dear Stephanie,  No one wants to raise a liar, but here’s the harsh truth: kids aren’t always honest. In fact, by the time they turn 4 years old, 90 percent of children have bended the truth. But how can parents avoid raising a lifelong liar?  “We punish bad behavior and we let the little lies slide, so they practice telling us what we want to hear, and they get better at it,” says Dr. Kat Shalhoub, PhD (https://katshalhoub.com/) . “We need to change the way we react to certain behavior; otherwise, it can lead to a lifetime of lying.”  Available for interviews, Q&As, and articles, Dr. Shalhoub (“Coach Kat”) can discuss:  · Why Kids Lie: Two key reasons kids bend the truth and how it can lead to permanent behavior · Seven tips for raising a more honest child and encouraging that behavior for life · There’s no such thing as a white lie: Why parents should never dismiss or laugh at small fibs · Change your tone! Make sure the way you react to poor behavior does not trigger fear  Please let me know if you’re interested in speaking with “Coach Kat” and/or receiving a copy of her new book, Futureproof. Thanks for your time, Stephanie. I look forward to hearing from you!

Millennials are often thought to be easily bored by meetings, as they typically spend the entirety of meetings going through their phones or laptops. However, millennials don't necessarily hate meetings-they simply want these meetings to matter. Read on for six ways to better engage millennials in meetings.

Millennial Meetings  Tip # 1: Bridge Generational Gaps  Millennials in most companies reportedly feel that senior coworkers and management don't relate to them. These generational gaps make it difficult for millennials to feel as though they are a valued part of the team, resulting in communication issues, as well as a distinct lack of respect for senior management.

5000g000028bDjWAAU,Protecting Our Children  [JSH-Online #31103],"Subject * Protecting Our Children Message *  August7,2019 Dear Christian Science Publishing Society, The continued killings of children and adults by young people has saddened our entire county and the world. As a longtime Christian Scientist, my heart goes out to the innocent. In prayer I have asked God what can I do? What do I need to know? I am only 1 person. Divine Love’s answer came a few days later. He told me that the children of this generation have not be been taught of the Lord. Very few if any have been taught the Ten Commandments, the beatitudes, the Golden Rule or how to pray. Gun laws can only do so much to protect children and adults. But knowledge of a Loving Creator who is with us all the time known as Immanuel will. But how do we get the word out there into the public? An idea came to me which I would love to share with you… The Christian Science Publishing Society could print a new poster with the afore mentioned ideas; The 10 commandments, The Beatitudes, The Golden Rule and the Lord’s Prayer. Maybe it could include The Children’s Prayer by Mary Baker Eddy. This idea could also be shared in pamphlet form at a reasonable price so that members could buy several copies to share with children and their parents. I would not consider this proselytizing.  The members could share it with people they know or with people Divine Mind has told them to share it with. It’s offering a cup of cold water in Christ’s name. It’s bringing the Truth to God’s little ones. It’s the best protection against evil, because it’s the Law of God-Good. For God is the preserver of man (and children). The poster and pamphlet could be available for sale through the Reading Rooms or on line. Thank you for considering this idea. We can all make a difference in this world and the future.

5000g000028b9meAAA,The Japanese and Western Science,"The Japanese first encountered Western scientific technology around 1543, when the Portuguese drifted ashore and left them firearms. For the next few centuries Japan's policy of national isolation severely limited contact with the West. In the middle of the nineteenth century, when Commodore Perry introduced the Japanese to a few of the West's technological achievements, they realized how vulnerable their technological ignorance made them and felt great pressure to master Western science as quickly as possible.  In The Japanese and Western Science, Masao Watanabe succinctly examines the intersection of Western science and Japanese culture since Japan's opening to the West. Using case studies, including a Japanese scientist trained in the West and foreign teachers brought to Japan, he describes how the Japanese quickly and effectively accepted Western science and technology.  http://www.upenn.edu/pennpress/book/1986.html   HOW JAPAN PICKS AMERICA'S BRAINS Much of its economic success has been built on bought, borrowed, or stolen technology. Now U.S. companies are striking back -- but a two-way street is still far off.  By Joel Dreyfuss REPORTER ASSOCIATE Carrie Gottlieb  December 21, 1987  FORTUNE Magazine) – AFTER ITS DEFEAT in World War II, Japan was content to take foreign inventions -- the transistor, the laser, the videotape player -- and convert them into products that it could market around the world. Japan acquired much of its base of Western technology, most of it American, perfectly legally through licensing, careful study of scientific papers and patents, and imitation. But when the U.S. wasn't willing to share, some Japanese companies simply copied with little regard for patents and other intellectual property rights that the courts have only recently begun to define in many areas of high technology.  The U.S., confident of its technical superiority, ''sold out to the Japanese,'' says G. Steven Burrill, head of the high-technology consulting group at Arthur Young, a Big Eight accounting firm. ''We let them share our brain.'' Now, belatedly awake to the recognition that Japan has been eating their breakfast, lunch, dinner, and bedtime snack, American companies are stirring. IBM vs. Fujitsu over computer software, Honeywell vs. Minolta over automatic focusing, Corning Glass vs. Sumitomo Electric over fiber optics -- these are only the latest, best-publicized complaints that Japan has stolen American technology. Even as those legal battles are fought out, the copycat cliche is becoming obsolete. A series of studies financed by the U.S. government since 1984 warn that Japan has caught up with the U.S. or passed it in the development of integrated circuits, fiber optics, computer hardware engineering, and advanced materials like polymers. It is pressing hard in some areas of biotechnology, and lags primarily in computer software. Already there are signs that the Japanese, buoyed by their new prowess, have assumed the arrogance of the U.S. along with its technology.  http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive /1987/12/21/69996/index.htm   PICKING JAPAN'S RESEARCH BRAINS At last U.S. companies are overcoming the ''not invented here'' syndrome and learning how to tap Japan's vast technological resources -- just as Japan has tapped America's.  By Susan Moffat REPORTER ASSOCIATE Joshua Mendes  March 25, 1991  For years Japan has come to the U.S., bought or borrowed the best of America's technology, and sold it back to the U.S. as finished products. Japanese companies have sent thousands of engineers to be trained at American universities and set up basic research labs on American turf: Computer giant NEC located its new $25 million lab in Princeton and hired top scientists from nearby Bell Labs to help lead it. Kobe Steel and Fujitsu have research centers in Silicon Valley. Sixteen Japanese companies have endowed chairs at MIT, at about $2 million a shot. So far, the technology flow has been pretty much one way. In 1989, U.S. companies took in $2.5 billion selling technology to the Japanese but spent only $500 million to buy technology from Japan. Now, though, more and more American high-tech companies are setting up laboratories in Japan, which could start reversing the imbalance.  THESE YOUNG AMERICANS are invited by leading high-tech companies to work in the inner sanctum of some of the best, most product-oriented research labs in Japan.  Many seem not to remember that the U.S. was once the world's best commercializer of imported inventions. Henry Ford reverse-engineered German car motors; the British invented jet engines.  http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive /1991/03/25/74810/index.htm   What's Intellectual Property and Does China Steal It?: QuickTake - Bloomberg  What is intellectual property?

The countries benefitting include Senegal, Mali, Mauritania, Burkina Faso and the Gambia.   These policies will unleash funds to assist vulnerable communities threatened by drought before it reaches catastrophic levels. Collectively, the purchased policies could release a total of US$ 49.5 million across the five countries. The World Food Programme (WFP) and the Start Network have purchased these “replica” climate risk insurance policies from the African Union’s Africa Risk Capacity (ARC), complementing those purchased by national governments.   This initiative, which is known under the name ‘ARC Replica’ allows governments and humanitarian agencies to quickly access and channel financing to vulnerable people in the event of an extreme drought.   “ARC Replica is strengthening the insurance coverage offered by ARC by increasing the sum insured for Mali,” explains WFP Country Director, Silvia Caruso. “This increases the number of people that will benefit from a payout in the case of a major drought.”  This financing helps to protect livestock and other assets, and to supplement feeding programs for undernourished children.  To ensure assistance reaches people in need quickly, Start Network and WFP have worked with each insured country to identify how resources and assistance can most efficiently be delivered.   “Many developing countries face the risk of disasters without being sufficiently prepared for them. When a disaster strikes, humanitarian organisations often respond too late, leaving affected populations vulnerable to further risk,” says KfW Development Bank project manager, Veronika Bertram-Hümmer. “We are very pleased to finance ARC Replica and work with the Start Network and the WFP to improve national preparedness and risk management efforts which ultimately allow us to help people affected by drought in West Africa and the Sahel.”  Through ARC Replica, the Start Network and WFP accompany governments in improving risk management practices, working collaboratively to strengthen safety nets and climate protection to vulnerable populations.   Mr. Abdoulaye Noba, Director of Civil Protection, Supervisor of the ARC Programme in Senegal, says that ""ARC Replica is an innovative project that enables ARC Member States and humanitarian partners to respond more effectively to disaster risks through funding mechanisms such as insurance.""  ARC and ARC Replica use pre-agreed triggers such as rainfall satellite data which allow for rapid response involving pre-agreed activities such as cash transfers and the distribution of food and nutrition supplements. The aim is to avoid situations where families take children out of school, migrate or sell livestock and seeds before the next agricultural season.   “We will keep working closely with the Government of Senegal, Start Network members in country and their partners to ensure that if a drought is detected, funds become available promptly to deliver support to vulnerable people,” says Anna Farina, Risk Financing Operations Lead at Start.   Pay-outs are made as early as two weeks after a failed harvest – months earlier than traditional humanitarian resources are made available. Typically, aid agencies are reliant on funding that gets provided by donors after a crisis has already taken place. By the time a crisis has been determined and humanitarian appeals have been formulated, many lives and livelihoods can be lost.                                                                                                  #         #         #  ARC and ARC Replica  The African Risk Capacity (ARC) is an institution set up by the African Union to strengthen African countries’ management of climate risk. This is achieved by offering governments drought insurance policies in exchange for an annual premium. ARC Replica is an insurance product offered by ARC Ltd to humanitarian organizations as an innovative approach to expand climate risk insurance coverage to more people and improve the effectiveness of emergency humanitarian response in vulnerable African countries prone to climate risks.  The Partners  ARC Replica in Mali, the Gambia, Burkina Faso and Mauritania is led by the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP). Saving lives in emergencies and changing lives for millions through sustainable development. WFP works in more than 80 countries around the world, feeding people caught in conflict and disasters, and laying the foundations for a better future. For WFP, ARC Replica fits into a wider risk financing portfolio with forecast-based financing and microinsurance programmes, such as the R4 Rural Resilience Initiative.   The Start Network^^[1] is the Replica partner in Senegal and it will sign a policy later this year in Madagascar.  The Start Network (https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/wf/click?upn=G62jSYfZdO-2F12d8lSllQB-2B38-2B938RfIQlo-2FOd39R3xQfYXCsm4zgbkf-2BSs7mZvDX_6pchHAirW10eM8b14ZAlkZkRllITHdt0G4CIxpgEX-2FYMT-2FVtvkhkoxOwXdc140hQDKip1v9w6NG6f4yMNdzd3I0JbBoOspHl9BOjIgd0xs1b-2FnJGB44-2FouotZgWz8KEUSJAgGQ3cwKxsBq9IuiB-2BSKaqCJ8DQhi7Y7xf0y3w4JKC989gTQ-2FBifn-2Fo-2ByaXUxalcsE213nrPiPCogxpWQRwExWly-2FkTdP5PsGQz3zP3-2BNjfPg31UKfPGkFnfoCf5NKht95yPurRCtsfS6lAojoETAOISjjqYQSsHRBKZMQMSfdA8j2IyYRIBiJzSDVvfF3TaH9u56iT20qnziZjQwCWGmveCXuACIcW54Q41j33Vk-3D aims to generate evidence from the ARC Replica initiative to inform the development of a ‘family’ of global financing mechanisms for frontline humanitarian responders, set to include a financial tool-box of products such as contingency funds, forecast-based-financing, and loans in addition to macro- and micro- insurance.

5000g000028bIuVAAU,Acclaimed artist tackles new topic for kids: managing mental health,"Dear Stephanie??,  Featured on Today, FOX, CNN, and other major media, Ruby Roth is a Los Angeles-based artist, author-illustrator, activist, and former teacher whose groundbreaking children's books have received international attention and have been translated into multiple languages.   Glamour called her work “an explosion of controversy,” and Jane Goodall said it’s “...powerful and important.” Ruby has 160,000+ followers and her media clips have over 2 million views.  Her newest and fifth picture book, Bad Day (https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/wf/click?upn=G62jSYfZdO-2F12d8lSllQB9cWY-2BGkynoTuCVydZSmJ1StdGXgqtIFfWMWnyfmeHJadYTWU2mpkZXR8S0nlsQakTlonKHB1hMlOc-2BOfHYuLu3sP0cTNTErrajDIAeAPbo1mFkxTYju-2BEbc4Z1AZe3oC4iXQhTJNBw9EHmE1J4-2BDIG5gsPzNJMEcEWLC12boXEH_6pchHAirW10eM8b14ZAlkZkRllITHdt0G4CIxpgEX-2FYMT-2FVtvkhkoxOwXdc140hQDKip1v9w6NG6f4yMNdzd3I0JbBoOspHl9BOjIgd0xs35giT-2BiE36sF2rIjLPGOgDYThq9KtzL3CTpFLIUOEfhVoFCAmj3gmFwqoRpQNs-2Btvu93SxoMONFcQH-2BI1OU1ML4Wkxb9A1qGKQeVYo2C7mGck5W4Jn5B8-2BOixrIBJmtdzHfUrBUToyB86hcSWJo253HxJK4Cw9j-2F2gtZs2NKqnoO-2FD0FLx-2BiOIY3VNLWumsdFUSkP8Qpa-2BV-2BC7cFNlztu6SxK3YNq-2BQsHzGTNbniNXGcg-2FtNl8P41hYiX8gS1r9-2FA-3D (preschool - 2nd grade, September 19, 2019, North Atlantic Books), is her first on issues of emotions and neuro-diversity.  Bad Day is especially timely due to growing concern for mental health and rising incidences of hypersensitivity and even violence in schools. Parents, childcare providers, and communities as a whole have a crucial responsibility to address strong emotions early in children’s lives. Bad Day encourages kids to take responsibility for their own wellbeing, and even further, to find strength and happiness in the process.   Would you be interested in speaking with Ruby or receiving a review copy when books arrive early next month?

Michigan Teen Lands Million Dollar Investment on Entrepreneur Magazine's ""Elevator Pitch"" Show 14-year-old Healthy Candy Queen Alina Morse Lands Massive Investment NEW YORK, August, 7, 2019 - Entrepreneur, the media powerhouse at the forefront  of the culture, mindset and the lifestyle of entrepreneurship for over 40 years,  released today's episode of ""Elevator Pitch,"" which saw 14-year-old Michigan TEENpreneur Alina Morse land a million dollar investment from Entrepreneur's Board of Investors looking for incumbent breaking brands to invest in that show real promise. Morse's company, Zolli Candy, is an all-natural candy that cleans your teeth and sold in  over 25,000 retailers. https://www.entrepreneur.com/video/337728 [http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001zQ2TRXOY1bheAbtg3CNne4T2EHpPoJsSLBYIxt6rRzIw2yJ2pe3HVfomQKUq8RffQEWllgmIMw_zkN80Sx-RLop3ngH3ECzFYKvpL1W7UvVip7GTxeM_QwMJzHGOArUcOjIrmEOEXd5YR1N5HejNPYixyzBshuHsQOxRhg3t_awc5rsqP9ryWiqJRZP7RF2KJ6VVWP-cA9Q=&c=EaFZVaShM9_TgKuOLlH4jNswtlV7Z-3bxkbzW0S9WzpAXKmYlFYCFg==&ch=YU6C1s-YwIqQzjzyhY0vM8zOeHCKLNSqq3xDPMLJ9TX0UdsEvRaxUg==] (9:32 mark) ""Landing such a massive deal on Elevator Pitch is going to be huge for Zolli Candy,"" said Morse, who graced Entrepreneur's cover in Sept. 2018 as its youngest ever cover star. ""I'm still in the middle of a capital raise, but to get the seal of approval from Entrepreneur that my company is a legitimate investment opportunity just shows we are really checking the boxes that investors look for as a sound investment."" Entrepreneur's ""Elevator Pitch"" (Season 4) invites ambitious entrepreneurs to step into the Entrepreneur Elevator, then gives them just 60 seconds to pique the judges' interest. It's a high-pressure, fast-paced environment in which startup founders  need to race against the clock while maintaining their composure to make a clear, deliberate pitch. The judges were all impressed with Morse's concise, knowledgeable pitch on Zolli Candy, handing her $1 million in exchange for an equity stake in  her business, while her peers where taking a final back in rural Michigan. The show airs on Entrepreneur.com as well as Cheddar, MSN Money, Apple TV, ROKU, Amazon,  and YouTube, and averages 2.1 MM views per episode. The episode closes with Morse at a Walgreens store showing her products in an end-cap display (22:32 mark). Earlier this Summer, Morse's company experienced sixty percent growth with her Zolli Candy Line's expansion into top drug store chains, CVS and Walgreens. She's the  #1 selling sugar-free candy sold on Amazon, exports to China, Korea and France,  and counts many of America's largest retailers as sellers of her products, including the #1 retailer, Walmart, and the #1 grocer, Kroger. Target and Whole Foods round out her domestic retail footprint. At age seven, while researching ways to create healthy candy she could have all  the time, Morse discovered that childhood tooth decay was the greatest epidemic  facing Kids, while recognizing the power of children's smiles. She then committed to do something about it. After learning how to make candy by watching YouTube Videos, she invented Zollipops®, the clean teen lollipops, and hit shelves in 2014 at age nine. She now commits 10 percent of profits to support an increase in oral health education in schools and has committed to giving 2-MM products through her ""Million Smiles Initiative"" to help fight America's most chronic childhood disease - tooth decay. Her Zolli Candy line also recently expanded from Zollipops, Zolli® Drops, and Zaffi® Taffy to also include: Zolli Caramelz, Zolli Gumeez, Zolli Beanz, and Zolli Ball  Pops. Her products are all-natural treats that are free of the top seven allergens & help clean your teeth. Morse was named by SUCCESS Magazine to their annual ranking of the 30 entrepreneur's under 30 years of age for 2019, while WGN Radio, the #1 talk-radio station in the Midwest for over 90+ years, named her the ""Most Valuable Person on the Planet"".  Additionally, InStyle Magazine named Morse one of ""The Badass 50: Women Who Are  Changing the World,"" which also included other trailblazers like former First Lady Michelle Obama, who hosted Morse at the White House twice to hand out candy at the annual Easter Egg Roll. In April, O, The Oprah Magazine, said the line was perfect for your next road trip because they leave your mouth feeling clean and fresh. She is also nominated for the 2019 Forbes 30 under 30. In late 2018, Morse shared her vision of schools of the future during her 2018 TED Talk, ""Why I eat candy to avoid Cavities."" She has spoke at the Lincoln Center in front of the National Principals Leadership Institute, leading others to help her peers and create sustainable programs and businesses to do it while doing good in the world. She's talked business on  the floor of the New York Stock Exchange and rubbed elbows with the Sharks on ABC's Shark Tank. Ripley's Believe It or Not! Special Edition 2017 included Morse's story in a book distributed to over one million schools, libraries, and families in North America. Following the launch of her company in 2015, Forbes named her product as one of ""Top 10 Emerging Food Trends"" while PEOPLE Magazine named it as part of their ""PEOPLE Great Ideas"" To learn more about the healthy, after-you-eat-treat, visit: http://www.ZolliCandy.com.

Plus, additional dates to be announced!  POSSUM LAKE, Ontario — Comedian Steve Smith, better known as Red Green, from the beloved Gemini Award-winning comedy series The Red Green Show (https://2911.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=bf141dbbd818f4f933816b13a&id=5aa3100ea7&e=08cf6d68c7) , has announced the addition of several new dates for his 'This Could Be It!' fall tour throughout Canada, with more shows to be announced. Kicking off September 19 in Grand Prairie, Alberta, Red Green embarks on his final journey throughout his homeland, with a coast-to-coast trek that will culminate on October 30th at the Georgian Theatre in Barrie, Ontario.  ""I know it's called 'This Could Be It' tour, but if I was a betting man, I'd put my money on 'This Is Definitely It,'"" said Smith.  Fans of all ages flocked to the various performance halls and theaters to take part in the final 'Lodge Meetings' throughout the U.S. With the majority of these meetings selling out, the hapless handyman has once again instilled countless laughs upon the smiling faces of his loyal fans, as he bids his final farewell.  ""The ticket sales have been great, but the biggest impact is the chance to say goodbye to my friends face-to-face, and to hear the heart-warming stories of how this silly little show has helped people's lives,"" Smith accounted. ""That's the part I'll remember forever.""  The master of misadventure continues his latest one man road show. It features some brand new handyman projects, advice to married guys and teenage boys, tips on getting old, and an apology to the world on behalf of all baby boomers. Special contributions from other cast members, talking animals, and a final wish from Red Green to all of his loyal fans, are also on the meeting agenda.  ""I'd like to also thank my fans, the media, and anyone who has supported me along the way,"" said Smith. ""I couldn't do any of this without you!""

Set way up north at the infamous Possum Lodge, The Red Green Show is a hilarious insight into men, their dreams, and their obsessions. It's a show for anyone who thinks God created man to give the rest of the world something to laugh at!  Steve Smith plays the acerbic, dry-witted Red Green, lodge leader and host of the show that takes special aim at the yet unexplored humorous side of the male ego and other inflatables. Pat McKenna plays Harold, Red's techno-geek nephew, and Rick Green (no relation to Red) is the klutzy naturalist Bill. Each week they pass the time bonding, adventuring, entrepreneuring and basically keeping the eight-year-old in them alive and well. # # # Suggested Tweet: .@Realredgreen (https://2911.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=bf141dbbd818f4f933816b13a&id=ecc170bd86&e=08cf6d68c7) adds more dates to Canadian tour kicking off Sept. 19 in Grand Prairie, Alberta.

But first a look at why the world should be watching Hong Kong.  These days, it would seem, authoritarianism is on the march. From Russia to the Philippines to Saudi Arabia, strongmen seem to be calling the shots. Elsewhere, strains of populism have some worried that democratic norms are under threat or already in tatters.  But in Hong Kong, protesters have put the strongest of strongmen – Chinese President Xi Jinping – in a bind. The demonstrators are increasingly worried that the Hong Kong they love is vanishing. The rights and liberties that have made the city a unique and flourishing hub of culture and global trade seem to be hanging in the balance. So The Wall Street Journal notes<https://www.wsj.com/articles/prepared-to-die-hong-kong-protesters-embrace-hard-core-tactics-challenge-beijing-11565038264> that protesters are becoming more desperate and radical in their determination to fight for their way of life.  It is a reminder that freedoms, once spread, are hard to take away. To be sure, mainland China holds the upper hand. But Hong Kong – and Taiwan – show that freedom and justice put down tenacious roots. For decades after World War II, the world took flawed but unprecedented steps to spread and protect freedoms across the globe. Hong Kong shows that such seeds can be transformative.  ~ [https://images.csmonitor.com/csm/2017/06/1025853_4_Mark-Sappenfield-drawing_standard.png?alias=square_400x400] <https://click.cssubs.com/?qs=220a9d3cc0d89f943b9d122dd246bf5131125e16b869a118e6c2a9d6cc76ef6ffee88dd6620a644b9c177414cb331d21c6e50364eb146bf3>  Mark Sappenfield  Editor  [twitter] @sappenfieldm <https://twitter.com/sappenfieldm?cmpid=ema:bundle:20190807&src=email>  [Daily facebook share] <https://click.cssubs.com/?qs=220a9d3cc0d89f941e8dc8b609dd5ff3d23bac040ebf1c13d5895baf428883dbe9419a3245f722a7003de39a1a8073016fa9e50c77fd7b68> [Daily twitter share]  <https://click.cssubs.com/?qs=220a9d3cc0d89f9491af6a962f666028b8c2bf8a2d38f4344b0a291c0190f8277b3f3c3df0d2dc58703a8bf2022ec94ced8f1d72a7839718> [Daily email share]  <mailto:?subject=I+think+you%27ll+like+this+article+from+the+Monitor+Daily&body=Here's%20the%20article%20on%20CSMonitor.com:+%0A%0A+Hong%20Kong%20protests%20show%20how%20deeply%20roots%20of%20freedom%20have%20grown+%0A%0A+https://www.csmonitor.com/Daily/2019/20190807/Hong-Kong-protests-show-how-deeply-roots-of-freedom-have-grown?src=shared+%0A%0A+You%20can%20try%20the%20Monitor%20Daily%20free%20for%20a%20week:%20https://www.csmonitor.com/dailyfreetrial> 1.

Its embrace of all isn’t going anywhere, they say, despite a terrorist attack aimed at its diversity.  – Mark  The 30 Sec. Read  As the sun set over El Paso, Texas, dozens of people gather outside the Immaculate Baptist Church for a vigil for the 22 people who died in an attack at a Walmart. Pastor J.C. Rico leads prayers in both English and Spanish.  “I refuse to let that change the way we live, change the way we are,” says Rosie Rico, the pastor’s wife.  The alleged gunman had no ties to this 400-year-old city on the banks of the Rio Grande. He drove more than 600 miles from a Dallas suburb to commit the attack, which law enforcement are treating as domestic terrorism. El Paso has been, for years now, statistically one of the safest cities in the country – but now some residents are questioning whether they are safe from the rest of America.  “It’s like we’re the antithesis of how a lot of people in the heartland, where I grew up, view us,” says Bill Clark, co-owner of the bookstore Literarity. “It’s probably the most welcoming city one could want to live in.”  Daniel Aguilar, who attended the vigil, says, “It sounds like [the gunman] was not getting love. He would have got love from us. We would have given him love.”  By Henry Gass  [twitter]@henrygass<https://twitter.com/henrygass?cmpid=ema:bundle:20190807&src=email>  Read 7 min.<https://www.csmonitor.com/Daily/2019/20190807?cmpid=ema:bundle:20190807&src=email&id=1093691>  ( 1648 words )  [Daily facebook share]<https://click.cssubs.com/?qs=220a9d3cc0d89f9451cb6f7ef8fdb0fca7d1d85c1f4808e1fab58b8406eb11c0755fc1b6070e9775163ec63e5ffc7eb85aaa098666a50245> [Daily twitter share] <https://click.cssubs.com/?qs=220a9d3cc0d89f940d2bc3192faa496f77e10cd2b473188cb09aba2404c3d880efdfc91e3a46af64cd4dcd58ee4239be00d37d0dce1d0bc2>  [Daily email share] <mailto:?subject=I+think+you%27ll+like+this+article+from+the+Monitor+Daily&body=Here's%20the%20article%20on%20CSMonitor.com:+%0A%0A+Why%20El%20Paso%20is%20determined%20not%20to%20roll%20up%20the%20welcome%20mat+%0A%0A+https://www.csmonitor.com/Daily/2019/20190807/Why-El-Paso-is-determined-not-to-roll-up-the-welcome-mat?src=shared+%0A%0A+You%20can%20try%20the%20Monitor%20Daily%20free%20for%20a%20week:%20https://www.csmonitor.com/dailyfreetrial> 2.

This story explains the thinking behind the deeper chess battle between the U.S. and China.  – Mark  The 30 Sec. Read  Fears of a currency war have piled atop anxiety about rising tariffs and their toll on the global economy.  Stock markets around the world swooned after Beijing allowed its currency to fall below a key level against the U.S. dollar. The United States declared China a currency manipulator. Meanwhile, the U.S. and other nations have shifted toward lowering interest rates – a move that can often result in weakening currencies.  But is this a currency war, a modern version of what happened during the Great Depression when nations devalued their currency in a vain attempt to boost their exports at the expense of others?  Many economists are skeptical. The big risk to global economic growth, they say, isn’t currency but tariffs – with the U.S. threats escalating against China last week. And the interest rate cuts can be explained as addressing that risk to overall growth, not as currency manipulation.  Pushing currency values lower can also blunt the impact of tariffs. Battles over currency “are not that bad,” says Olivier Jeanne, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. But as a tool in a rising trade war, it’s worrying.

Or shared interests? The principle guiding President Trump’s “transactional” diplomacy has been more the latter. Among Gulf Arabs, that’s created competition for good U.S. relations.  – Mark  The 30 Sec. Read  President Donald Trump’s about-face on Qatar – receiving the emir, Sheikh Tamim al-Thani, at the White House in July as an “old friend” two years after condemning the Gulf Arab state as a “funder of terrorism” – was telling.  It potentially shifted the balance of power in the Gulf, opening a door to a resurgence of multilateralism in the region. And, say observers and officials there, it exposed the limits of influence achieved by Qatar’s rivals, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, in a transactional White House.  Just as Mr. Trump touted Saudi Arabia’s billions in arms deals during a March 2018 visit by the crown prince, in the recent visit by the emir, Qatar inked tens of billions of dollars in deals with Raytheon, Boeing, and Chevron. It was a case of Qatar beating Saudi Arabia and the UAE at their own game.  Says Andreas Krieg, a lecturer in security studies at King’s College London: “The Qataris understood that Trump is very much a transactional president – as much as the Saudis and the UAE understand – you need to pour money into the country in order to win his favor.”  By Taylor Luck  Read 5 min.<https://www.csmonitor.com/Daily/2019/20190807?cmpid=ema:bundle:20190807&src=email&id=1093695>  ( 1195 words )  [Daily facebook share]<https://click.cssubs.com/?qs=220a9d3cc0d89f948287153b0ff67e427e99fd567f673346538e04c9bcc45e61816e9671356e86136fa42dc80c26e0eb70f0066797ec6480> [Daily twitter share] <https://click.cssubs.com/?qs=220a9d3cc0d89f94ba18cb553ae7d4afd11175ea62f711b31100dc642765f6c9e4d2c966fd4fc3bd4045516005c822c41632e8ddaf143192>  [Daily email share] <mailto:?subject=I+think+you%27ll+like+this+article+from+the+Monitor+Daily&body=Here's%20the%20article%20on%20CSMonitor.com:+%0A%0A+Checkbook%20diplomacy?%20How%20Qatar’s%20renewed%20US%20ties%20reshape%20the%20Gulf.+%0A%0A+https://www.csmonitor.com/Daily/2019/20190807/Checkbook-diplomacy-How-Qatar-s-renewed-US-ties-reshape-the-Gulf?src=shared+%0A%0A+You%20can%20try%20the%20Monitor%20Daily%20free%20for%20a%20week:%20https://www.csmonitor.com/dailyfreetrial> Point of Progress What's going right 4.

Behind their surprise resurgence is renewed emphasis on fostering community.  – Mark  The 30 Sec. Read  In the past decade, the number of independent bookstores in the United States has grown by more than 50%, from 1,651 stores to more than 2,500, according to Dan Cullen, senior strategy officer of the American Booksellers Association.  Observers say a special blend of local flavor, dedication to physical books, accessibility to authors, and a business model that includes other revenue streams has fueled the resurgence. The formula has proved so successful chains are working to bring a small-venue feel to their big-box stores.  “One of the key ingredients to the independent bookseller is this notion of community,” says Ryan Raffaelli, an assistant professor at Harvard Business School. Owners often sit on city boards and are active in public schools, he says.  Patricia Fowler, owner of Village Square Booksellers in Bellows Falls, Vermont, serves as treasurer for two local community groups and participated in a program to support high schoolers as they plan for the future.  “Some of our customers that started out reading picture books are now into the teen and young adult books,” says Ms. Fowler. “We grow with our customers.”  By Thomas Shults  Read 3 min.<https://www.csmonitor.com/Daily/2019/20190807?cmpid=ema:bundle:20190807&src=email&id=1093770>  ( 649 words )  [Daily facebook share]<https://click.cssubs.com/?qs=220a9d3cc0d89f947051f977cf26f6866d69dc21faef93b5d15c6553740d662cc215a774ff82e57ce4921b08a62805a2653b0f3a1e549e2a> [Daily twitter share] <https://click.cssubs.com/?qs=220a9d3cc0d89f94bd51d3537a55593f1d40c9681b68fd600718770a1040c75b73e289a43c1e5efc54509f1e4c2b62e32bf6247bf8aa3230>  [Daily email share] <mailto:?subject=I+think+you%27ll+like+this+article+from+the+Monitor+Daily&body=Here's%20the%20article%20on%20CSMonitor.com:+%0A%0A+Comeback%20story:%20A%20new%20chapter%20for%20indie%20bookstores+%0A%0A+https://www.csmonitor.com/Daily/2019/20190807/Comeback-story-A-new-chapter-for-indie-bookstores?src=shared+%0A%0A+You%20can%20try%20the%20Monitor%20Daily%20free%20for%20a%20week:%20https://www.csmonitor.com/dailyfreetrial> Difference-maker Drivers of change 5.

For one couple, it means they haven’t had the time or money to leave their locale for two years. But it also means a deep connection to animals in need.  – Mark  The 30 Sec. Read  With its wild ’80s-rock-star mane, muscular body, and charismatic nature, the Skyrian horse has become a sort of cultural icon for the Greek island of Skíros. But today, there are fewer than 300 of these horses left worldwide, maybe 200 if counting only purebreds.  Stathis Katsarelias was drawn to the breed and its cultural significance. “I felt this duty because I’m from Skíros,” he says. “As a Skyrian, we should care about them.”  “They will grab your soul and your heart,” says his partner, Amanda Simpson.  In 2005, Ms. Simpson and Mr. Katsarelias started Skyros Island Horse Trust. From the beginning, its mission was twofold: take care of the existing population on Skíros and selectively breed the horse to create a more robust breed. When they started the project, they took in horses from locals who could no longer care for them, as well as some starving horses wandering on the mountainside. They started with four horses. Today, there are 35.  “When I see them here, and I understand that they feel safe, and that they feel secure, and that they are relaxed, this gives me the strength to go on,” says Mr. Katsarelias.

Read  Police are still trying to pin down the exact motives for last weekend’s killings in two American cities. But one motive fits both. Each dehumanized their victims out of rage. Yet not surprisingly, a few of the victims’ families as well as community leaders have refused to reciprocate the rage. They have offered forgiveness.  Acts of forgiveness after a massacre are rare. Yet they can be powerful. In a reminder of what is possible, a documentary came out this spring that details the forgiveness given to Dylan Roof by families of victims killed in 2015 at a black church in Charleston, South Carolina. In the new film “Emanuel,” Chris Singleton, the son of one victim in the church, says his forgiveness was not a choice to “move on.” It took strength to forgive. And it allowed him to be free of anger, to spread love and unity, and to work to prevent similar tragedies.  The impersonal hate of the shooters in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, deserves a response at many levels – justice in the courts, reforms in legislatures, and denunciation of their motives. Yet none may be as powerful to prevent more shootings than forgiveness.

Today, our five handpicked stories start with an extraordinarily beautiful portrait of the grace of El Paso. We also pull back the curtain on the U.S.-China economic battle, look at how President Donald Trump’s approach to foreign policy is changing the Middle East, examine why independent bookstores endure, and tell the story of one family’s amazing dedication to save a rare horse breed.But first a look at why the world should be watching Hong Kong.These days, it would seem, authoritarianism is on the march. From Russia to the Philippines to Saudi Arabia, strongmen seem to be calling the shots. Elsewhere, strains of populism have some worried that democratic norms are under threat or already in tatters.But in Hong Kong, protesters have put the strongest of strongmen – Chinese President Xi Jinping – in a bind. The demonstrators are increasingly worried that the Hong Kong they love is vanishing. The rights and liberties that have made the  city a unique and flourishing hub of culture and global trade seem to be hanging in the balance. So The Wall Street Journal notes that protesters are becoming more desperate and radical in their determination to fight for their way of life.It is a reminder that freedoms, once spread, are hard to take away. To be sure, mainland China holds the upper hand. But Hong Kong – and Taiwan – show that freedom and justice put down tenacious roots. For decades after World War II, the world took flawed but unprecedented steps to spread and protect freedoms across the globe. Hong Kong shows that such seeds can be transformative. ~   |      |      | |  Mark Sappenfield  Editor    @sappenfieldm    |      |            |       |   |  |  |   |    |       |    1. Why El Paso is determined not to roll up the welcome mat    |     |       Callaghan O'Hare/Reuters    |       |   El Paso is an old city with a big heart, residents told our reporter. Its embrace of all isn’t going anywhere, they say, despite a terrorist attack aimed at its diversity.   |      |  – Mark   |       |  The 30 Sec. Read  | |   As the sun set over El Paso, Texas, dozens of people gather outside the Immaculate Baptist Church for a vigil for the 22 people who died in an attack at a Walmart. Pastor J.C. Rico leads prayers in both English and Spanish.“I refuse to let that change the way we live, change the way we are,” says Rosie Rico, the pastor’s wife.The alleged gunman had no ties to this 400-year-old city on the banks of the Rio Grande. He drove more than 600 miles from a Dallas suburb to commit the attack, which law enforcement are treating as domestic terrorism. El Paso has been, for years now, statistically one of the safest cities in the country – but now some residents are questioning whether they are safe from the rest of America.“It’s like we’re the antithesis of how a lot of people in the heartland, where I grew up, view us,” says Bill Clark, co-owner of the bookstore Literarity. “It’s probably the most welcoming city one could want to live in.”Daniel Aguilar, who attended the  vigil, says, “It sounds like [the gunman] was not getting love. He would have got love from us. We would have given him love.”   | |  By Henry Gass   | |   @henrygass   | |  Read 7 min.  | |  ( 1648 words )   | |       |       |    2. Currency manipulator? What latest twist in trade war means.    |     |       Chinatopix/AP    |       |   The recent stock market jolt underlines the complex consequences of trade wars and currency manipulation. This story explains the thinking behind the deeper chess battle between the U.S. and China.   |      |  – Mark   |       |  The 30 Sec. Read  | |   Fears of a currency war have piled atop anxiety about rising tariffs and their toll on the global economy.Stock markets around the world swooned after Beijing allowed its currency to fall below a key level against the U.S. dollar. The United States declared China a currency manipulator. Meanwhile, the U.S. and other nations have shifted toward lowering interest rates – a move that can often result in weakening currencies.But is this a currency war, a modern version of what happened during the Great Depression when nations devalued their currency in a vain attempt to boost their exports at the expense of others?Many economists are skeptical. The big risk to global economic growth, they say, isn’t currency but tariffs – with the U.S. threats escalating against China last week. And the interest rate cuts can be explained as addressing that risk to overall growth, not as currency manipulation.Pushing currency values lower can also blunt the impact of tariffs.  Battles over currency “are not that bad,” says Olivier Jeanne, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. But as a tool in a rising trade war, it’s worrying.   | |  By Laurent Belsie   | |   @lbelsie   | |  Read 5 min.  | |  ( 1069 words )   | |       |       |    3. Checkbook diplomacy?

Among Gulf Arabs, that’s created competition for good U.S. relations.   |      |  – Mark   |       |  The 30 Sec. Read  | |   President Donald Trump’s about-face on Qatar – receiving the emir, Sheikh Tamim al-Thani, at the White House in July as an “old friend” two years after condemning the Gulf Arab state as a “funder of terrorism” – was telling.It potentially shifted the balance of power in the Gulf, opening a door to a resurgence of multilateralism in the region. And, say observers and officials there, it exposed the limits of influence achieved by Qatar’s rivals, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, in a transactional White House.Just as Mr. Trump touted Saudi Arabia’s billions in arms deals during a March 2018 visit by the crown prince, in the recent visit by the emir, Qatar inked tens of billions of dollars in deals with Raytheon, Boeing, and Chevron. It was a case of Qatar beating Saudi Arabia and the UAE at their own game.Says Andreas Krieg, a lecturer in security studies at King’s College London: “The Qataris understood that Trump is very much a transactional president  – as much as the Saudis and the UAE understand – you need to pour money into the country in order to win his favor.”   | |  By Taylor Luck   | |  Read 5 min.  | |  ( 1195 words )   | |       |       |  Point of Progress  What's going right   | |    4. Comeback story: A new chapter for indie bookstores    |     |      |       |   While their numbers aren’t what they once were, independent bookstores are reclaiming their place in society. Behind their surprise resurgence is renewed emphasis on fostering community.    |      |  – Mark   |       |  The 30 Sec. Read  | |   In the past decade, the number of independent bookstores in the United States has grown by more than 50%, from 1,651 stores to more than 2,500, according to Dan Cullen, senior strategy officer of the American Booksellers Association. Observers say a special blend of local flavor, dedication to physical books, accessibility to authors, and a business model that includes other revenue streams has fueled the resurgence. The formula has proved so successful chains are working to bring a small-venue feel to their big-box stores. “One of the key ingredients to the independent bookseller is this notion of community,” says Ryan Raffaelli, an assistant professor at Harvard Business School. Owners often sit on city boards and are active in public schools, he says. Patricia Fowler, owner of Village Square Booksellers in Bellows Falls, Vermont, serves as treasurer for two local community groups and participated in a program to support high schoolers as they plan for the  future. “Some of our customers that started out reading picture books are now into the teen and young adult books,” says Ms. Fowler. “We grow with our customers.”   | |  By Thomas Shults   | |  Read 3 min.  | |  ( 649 words )   | |       |       |  Difference-maker  Drivers of change   | |    5.

Read  | |   With its wild ’80s-rock-star mane, muscular body, and charismatic nature, the Skyrian horse has become a sort of cultural icon for the Greek island of Skíros. But today, there are fewer than 300 of these horses left worldwide, maybe 200 if counting only purebreds.Stathis Katsarelias was drawn to the breed and its cultural significance. “I felt this duty because I’m from Skíros,” he says. “As a Skyrian, we should care about them.”“They will grab your soul and your heart,” says his partner, Amanda Simpson.In 2005, Ms. Simpson and Mr. Katsarelias started Skyros Island Horse Trust. From the beginning, its mission was twofold: take care of the existing population on Skíros and selectively breed the horse to create a more robust breed. When they started the project, they took in horses from locals who could no longer care for them, as well as some starving horses wandering on the mountainside. They started with four horses. Today, there are 35.“When I see them here,  and I understand that they feel safe, and that they feel secure, and that they are relaxed, this gives me the strength to go on,” says Mr. Katsarelias.   | |  By Becky Holladay   | |  Read 5 min.  | |  ( 1155 words )   | |       |       |  The Monitor's View     | |    In Dayton and El Paso, the potential power of forgiveness    |     |  The 30 Sec. Read  | |   Police are still trying to pin down the exact motives for last weekend’s killings in two American cities. But one motive fits both. Each dehumanized their victims out of rage. Yet not surprisingly, a few of the victims’ families as well as community leaders have refused to reciprocate the rage. They have offered forgiveness.Acts of forgiveness after a massacre are rare. Yet they can be powerful. In a reminder of what is possible, a documentary came out this spring that details the forgiveness given to Dylan Roof by families of victims killed in 2015 at a black church in Charleston, South Carolina. In the new film “Emanuel,” Chris Singleton, the son of one victim in the church, says his forgiveness was not a choice to “move on.” It took strength to forgive. And it allowed him to be free of anger, to spread love and unity, and to work to prevent similar tragedies.The impersonal hate of the shooters in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, deserves a response at many  levels – justice in the courts, reforms in legislatures, and denunciation of their motives. Yet none may be as powerful to prevent more shootings than forgiveness.   | |  By the Monitor's Editorial Board   | |  Read 3 min.  | |  ( 603 words )   | |       |       |  A Christian Science Perspective  ( About this feature )   | |    Listening for the voice of Love, not hate    |     |   It’s not always easy to let love lead us forward instead of hate, especially in the wake of tragic events.

5000g000028bOATAA2,Editorial comments and corrections,"The following information was collected:  Name: John  Email: robledoint@yahoo.com  Subscriber: No  Subject: FBI Insider Reveals What Triggered El Paso Shooter 's Rampage , and Dems Are Not going to like It  Product: csmonitor.com  Message:  FBI Insider Reveals What Triggered El Paso Shooter’s Rampage, And Dems Are Not Going To Like It  (Tea Party PAC) – While the Democrat-media complex didn’t bat an eye before diving head-first into the narrative that the monster who opened fire on Wal-Mart shoppers in El Paso, Texas over the weekend was a died-in-the-wool Trump supporter, as usual, this couldn’t be further from the truth.  No, the El Paso shooter explicitly separated his motives from the president, noting that he was sure his actions would be blamed on Trump anyway.  Check out this op-ed at The Intercept where the author seems to be desperate to convince readers–and even herself–that it’s still somehow Trump’s fault:  THE FOUR-PAGE MANIFESTO believed to be written by suspected El Paso mass shooter Patrick Crusius abounds with Trumpian racist nationalism. “This attack is a response to the Hispanic invasion of Texas,” notes the text, published shortly before Saturday’s massacre. The manifesto, which decries “race-mixing,” states, “some people will blame the president or certain presidential candidates for the attack. This is not the case,” noting that the author’s convictions “predate Trump.” Commentators such as my colleague Mehdi Hasan are nonetheless right to place blame at the feet of President Donald Trump, whose putrid anti-immigrant rhetoric and policies have emboldened violent white supremacists.  Keep telling yourself that, lady.  No, as it so happens (shocker), the shooter wasn’t at all triggered by anything the president said or did. In fact, during his El Paso rally earlier this year, POTUS couldn’t stop gushing about how much he loved the city of El Paso and the state of Texas, which this psychotic shooter dismissed as “race-mixing” states.  This week, former FBI Agent Steve Hooper joined radio host Mike Broomhead on the Mike Broomhead Show on KFYI 550 AM in Phoenix.  Hooper, a 30-year veteran of the bureau, said that the El Paso shooter, during interviews, said that he was in fact triggered after watching the DNC debates, particularly the moment when all the candidates raised their hands when asked if they’d be willing to fund health insurance for illegal immigrants.  Not Trump’s language.  “When the most recent debate when they all said free healthcare, they all raised their hands,” Hooper explained. “That’s what pushed him over the edge. He felt he was justified. He felt he ran out of alternatives.”  That is what you call a mentally unstable individual. Someone without morals or scruples, with no idea how to regulate their own emotions or function in a civil society.  It’s no wonder is manifesto is full of bizarre, fringe politics.  This wasn’t a Republican or a Democrat, this was a cold-hearted extremist who was clearly on the verge of a breakdown. Police say he expressed no remorse or regret for his actions.  This isn’t a gun problem. This isn’t a politics problem. This is a crazy person problem, and that is what is an epidemic. We have young men being raised in this country with absolutely no moral backbone or sense of purpose to their lives.  We have to do better, America.  Listen to the full audio from Hooper and Mike Broomhead here:  30 years experience as an FBI agent Steve Hooper talks FBI involvement when it comes to combating domestic terrorism.  Posted by The Mike Broomhead Show on Tuesday, August 6, 2019  Here is a flashback to that startling moment when the Democrats went all-in for funding illegal immigrant’s healthcare:  WATCH: Every Democrat wants to give free health care to illegal immigrants and sticking working class American citizens with the bill. #DemDebate pic.twitter.com/C9VljMAy8U  — Trump War Room (@TrumpWarRoom) June 28, 2019  And the response from Republicans and conservatives, none of which, it must be noted, went on shooting rampages because they’re all decent, sensible people:  Is this real life?

The College holds the number 12 spot on the Best Career Services list. The ranking, which follows Princeton Review’s determination this spring that Grove City College is ranked number 11 for Best Schools for Internships, bolsters the College’s position as a great place for students to begin successful and rewarding careers.  “We strive to provide first-rate and comprehensive opportunities for our students during their time here and to play a central part of our students’ college experience.

Grove City College graduates post a 96-percent success rate based on career and graduate school placement six months after graduation. Alumni earn higher than average starting ($53,500) and mid-career ($103,300) salaries, according to PayScale.  “Boasting ‘very high job placement rates,’ Grove City prides itself on helping students succeed during and after their formal education. One student says, ‘The greatest strength of my school is how dedicated they are to helping students find a job and create a future. The Career Services Office is dedicated to helping students in any way that they can and have special events to help students network,’” Princeton Review reports.  The College’s annual Career Fair is one of the largest in the region, drawing over 170 employers and graduate schools each fall. This year’s Career Fair is set for Sept. 25. The Career Services Office facilitated 247 on-campus recruiting events last year, drawing employers like Amazon, IBM, PNC Financial Services Group and Nestle  ""We chose the 385 colleges for this edition as our 'best' overall, academically, based on data we gathered in 2018–19 from more than a thousand school administrators about their schools' academic programs and offerings,"" said Robert Franek, The Princeton Review's editor-in-chief and lead author of “The Best 385 Colleges.” The Princeton Review surveys college administrators and students, visits campuses, relies on staff reports and a National College Counselor Advisory Board to select schools for the guide, Franek said.  Outstanding academics, interesting professors, Christian community, high quality campus life and an unwavering focus on student flourishing are among the factors that students value most about Grove City College, according to The Princeton Review.  The guide reports that many students are attracted to the College because of its Christ-centered learning and living environment. “The low cost of tuition is just gravy, as is the strong alumni network and ‘really good reputation with employers,’” according to the guide.  Once again, The Princeton Review recognized the College for its engaged community by virtue of supporting one of the largest intramural sports programs in the country.

More than 500 objects from the museum collection that have never before been on permanent public display will make their debut as part of the newly renovated galleries (some images in this link: <https://uchicago.box.com/s/0hl3q75l5w4bb89hjuimjvf80s81vac7> https://uchicago.box.com/s/0hl3q75l5w4bb89hjuimjvf80s81vac7  A leading research institution with a world-class museum frequently described as a hidden gem, the OI houses the largest collection of ancient Middle Eastern artifacts in the United States, with more than 350,000 artifacts in its collection, mainly excavated by OI archaeologists, and some 5,000 on display to the public.      Visitors to the museum can follow the rise and fall of the earliest civilizations through artifacts that include early stone tools from the dawn of agriculture, a colossal 40-ton winged bull from the Assyrian palace of Sargon II at Dur-Sharrukin (modern Khorsabad), and a fragment of an early Islamic manuscript that contains the oldest known text of the famous A Thousand and One Nights (image in this link: <https://uchicago.box.com/s/0hl3q75l5w4bb89hjuimjvf80s81vac7> https://uchicago.box.com/s/0hl3q75l5w4bb89hjuimjvf80s81vac7     The OI also will unveil new works from internationally acclaimed contemporary artists Ann Hamilton and Michael Rakowitz as part of the Centennial celebration. Additionally, Syrian artist and architect Mohamad Hafez will serve as the OI's first interpreter-in-residence, exhibiting his work at the OI Museum and presenting public programs throughout the 2019-2020 academic year that connect OI artifacts with the contemporary Middle East. All three artists' works will illuminate, or directly engage with, artifacts within the OI's expansive collection (see press release below).

Additionally, Syrian artist and architect Mohamad Hafez will serve as the OI's first interpreter-in-residence, exhibiting his work at the OI Museum and presenting public programs throughout the 2019-2020 academic year.     All three contemporary artists' works will illuminate, or directly engage with, artifacts within the OI's expansive collection. The OI Museum exhibits the largest collection of ancient Middle East artifacts in the United States, with more than 350,000 artifacts mainly excavated by OI archaeologists and some 5,000 on display to the public.     The new artworks will be officially unveiled at a festive public OI Centennial celebration on Saturday, September 28, from 1 p.m.-5 p.m. at the OI Museum (1155 E. 58th Street), including music performances from the Hyde Park Jazz Festival, an artifact ""scavenger hunt"" for children, and gallery tours and talks by OI scholars and archaeologists. For more information and the most up-to-date schedule of events, visit  <http://oi100.uchicago.edu/> oi100.uchicago.edu.     Visual art programming commemorating the OI Centennial includes:     .        Ann Hamilton, recipient of the National Medal of Arts and a MacArthur ""Genius"" Fellowship, will create a new large-scale installation in the Mansueto Grand Reading Room at UChicago's Regenstein Library for her project aeon, affixing to the room's massive glass dome a series of translucent images of OI artifacts that she produced using a small flatbed desktop scanner and a handheld wand scanner. After several thousand years entombed underground, and nearly a century enclosed in the OI's display cases, the ancient figures are illuminated and ""animated"" through Hamilton's ethereal images. Her aeon project will also include a book and limited-edition portfolio of prints.     .        Iraqi-American artist Michael Rakowitz will create a site-specific installation as part of his series The invisible enemy should not exist. These include reappearances of reliefs from the Northwest Palace at Nimrud, destroyed by Isis in 2015, made using contemporary Middle Eastern newspapers and packaging from northern Iraqi foods. In the OI collection is a Northwest Palace relief fragment with the head of the Assyrian king (obtained on exchange with the British Museum). Rakowitz and his studio will reproduce the remainder of the panel, with the final artwork displayed in the OI Museum's Dr. Norman Solhkhah Family Assyrian Empire Gallery.     .        Syrian artist and architect Mohamad Hafez will exhibit works at the OI Museum including  <http://www.mohamadhafez.com/Hiraeth> Hiraeth and <http://www.mohamadhafez.com/Collateral-Damage> Collateral Damage. His works and associated public programming as the OI's first interpreter-in-residence will explore the links between the loss of ancient artifacts in the Middle East and contemporary loss of human life and human suffering in Syria and other parts of the Middle East. Hafez will create links between past and present geographies, humanizing ancient history so that visitors to the OI Museum understand that the artifacts on display, thousands of years old, come from the same place as the Middle East of today.     The works by Rakowitz and Hafez will be exhibited at the OI Museum throughout the 2019-2020 academic year. Hamilton's aeon installation will remain in Regenstein Library through the end of November.     ""We're proud to be collaborating with artists of this caliber,"" said OI Chief Curator and Deputy Director of the Museum Jean M. Evans. ""It's great to find new ways to connect visitors to the ancient past and to make that past more immediate and tangible.""     Telling stories that date back thousands of years in human history, the OI explores how humans, together, have been grappling with similar challenges since ancient times-and how the study of these first civilizations can illuminate contemporary social, political, religious, and environmental issues.     Since its founding in 1919, the OI has led a century of excavations and research projects throughout the Middle East, many of which continue today in countries including Egypt, Iraq, Turkey, and Afghanistan. The comprehensive and rigorous work of OI scholars deciphers ancient languages; reconstructs histories, literatures, and religions of long-lost civilizations; and creates transformative dictionaries that serve as cultural encyclopedias essential to understanding the ancient world.     Visitors to the OI Museum can follow the growth and journey of the earliest settlements, civilizations, and empires through the artifacts on display-including early stone tools at the dawn of agriculture from Jarmo, a colossal 40-ton winged bull from the Assyrian palace of Sargon II at Dur-Sharrukin (modern Khorsabad), and a fragment from the oldest known manuscript of the famous A Thousand and One Nights.

ARTIST BIOS     Mohamad Hafez is an interdisciplinary artist and architect born in Syria, raised in Saudi Arabia and educated in the Midwestern United States. A self-taught sculptor, Hafez uses his expertise as a licensed AIA architect as well as his lived experience of Damascus's rich built environment to create poetic streetscapes high in fidelity and charged in content. His mixed-media sculptural compilations of objects anchor uneasy conversations, stimulating deeper audience engagement on contentious topics like torture and prisoner abuse, child starvation in Africa, or the ongoing global refugee crisis. Hafez studied at Damascus University and Northern Illinois University before earning his B.Arch. at Iowa State University in 2009. Hafez began practicing sculpture shortly after coming to the U.S. in 2003, out of homesickness and nostalgia provoked by prohibitive Bush-era NSEERS travel restrictions. Hafez has exhibited at The Brooklyn Museum, UNICEF House, NYC; Orlando Museum of Art, Florida; Yale Art Gallery, New Haven; and Contemporary Art Platform, Kuwait, among others. He has received national attention in the New York Times, The New Yorker, Boston Globe, AJ+, Global Citizen, The Guardian, and NPR. Hafez is currently full-time with the firm Pickard Chilton and was Project Lead Designer on the 2017 50-story, 1.5 million GSF office tower 609 Main in downtown Houston, TX. Hafez is the recipient of a 2018 Connecticut Arts Hero Award for his extensive and continuous body of work on issues such as the Syrian civil war, the worldwide refugee crisis, and an overall desire to counter hate speech. He serves as a 2018 Yale University Silliman College Fellow and artist-in-residence at the Keller Center of Harris School of Public Policy, University of Chicago.     Ann Hamilton is a visual artist internationally acclaimed for her large-scale multi-media installations, public projects, and performance collaborations. Hamilton uses common materials as a means of addressing the knowledge that comes from language and touch, creating site-responsive installations for individual and collective experience. Hamilton has received the National Medal of Arts, MacArthur Fellowship, Guggenheim Memorial Fellowship, NEA Visual Arts Fellowship, United States Artists Fellowship, the Heinz Award, and was selected to represent the United States at the 1991 Sao Paulo Biennial and the 1999 Venice Biennale. She received a BFA in textile design from the University of Kansas in 1979 and an MFA in Sculpture from the Yale University School of Art in 1985. Hamilton currently lives in Columbus, Ohio where she is Distinguished University Professor of Art at The Ohio State University.     Michael Rakowitz is an artist living and working in Chicago. His work has appeared in venues worldwide including dOCUMENTA (13), P.S.1, MoMA, MassMOCA, Castello di Rivoli, the 16th Biennale of Sydney, the 10th and 14th Istanbul Biennials, Sharjah Biennial 8, Tirana Biennale, National Design Triennial at the Cooper-Hewitt, and Transmediale 05. He has had solo projects and exhibitions with Creative Time, Tate Modern in London, MCA Chicago, Lombard Freid Gallery in New York, Galerie Barbara Wien, Berlin, Rhona Hoffman Gallery, Chicago and Kunstraum Innsbruck. He is the recipient of the 2018 Herb Alpert Award in the Arts; a 2012 Tiffany Foundation Award; a 2008 Creative Capital Grant; a Sharjah Biennial Jury Award; a 2006 New York Foundation for the Arts Fellowship Grant in Architecture and Environmental Structures; the 2003 Dena Foundation Award, and the 2002 Design 21 Grand Prix from UNESCO. He was awarded the Fourth Plinth commission in London's Trafalgar Square, on view through 2020. A survey of his work is on view at Whitechapel Gallery in London and will travel to Castello di Rivoli Museo d'Arte Contemporanea in Torino in 2019 and The Jameel Arts Centre in Dubai in 2020. Rakowitz is Professor of Art Theory and Practice at Northwestern University.     ABOUT THE OI AND UCHICAGO     The Oriental Institute (OI) was founded at the University of Chicago in 1919 by James Henry Breasted with a radical idea. He insisted that who we are-how we live as humans together-began not in Greece or Rome, but rather in the complex civilizations that emerged in an area of the ancient Middle East that he vividly named ""The Fertile Crescent."" Breasted was appointed as faculty in 1894 by William R. Harper, the first president of the University of Chicago, and received financial support and encouragement from John D. Rockefeller, Jr., for the founding of the OI. The OI is one of the world's leading centers for the study of ancient Middle Eastern civilizations, combining innovation in theory, methodology, and significant empirical discovery with the highest standards of rigorous scholarship. The OI Museum was opened to the public in 1931 and houses the largest collection of artifacts from the ancient Middle East in the United States, including more than 350,000 artifacts with roughly 5,000 on display. The majority of the collections come from the OI's expeditions in the Middle East during the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s. For more information visit <http://oi100.uchicago.edu/> oi100.uchicago.edu.     About the University of Chicago  The University of Chicago is a leading academic and research institution that has driven new ways of thinking since its founding in 1890. As an intellectual destination, the University draws scholars and students from around the world to its campuses in Hyde Park and Hong Kong, and centers around the globe.

I heard of Christian Science for which I have developed much interest in understanding more; through one Mr. Daniel Atidzon.    I would want more information as to how to become a prominent credible member one day.    What thrilled me most was the realization that this same Daniel Atidzon authored an article entitled: INSPIRED AND GUIDED BY THE MANUAL OF THE MOTHER CHURCH, published in your May 2019 publication of the Christian Science Journal. After reading, I got in touch with Daniel! I spoke with him! I thank God; Daniel is now my great coach in Christian Science. In just about a month, I have come into contact with Daniel and already so much has changed in my thought and life! I am so grateful to Christian Science.    From Daniel’s article, I learnt that I could be a Christian Scientist only when ‘I quit my reliance upon that which is false and grasp that which is true.’ I also learnt that I could not be one until I leave all for Christ! In the article, it is explained that, human opinions are not spiritual, of which I agree, looking back at my own lifetime experience. In addition, the article suggest that, those human opinions come from the hearing of the ear, from corporeality instead of from principle and from mortal instead of from the immortal.    If I have questions to know more, the first one shall be insight into how your Church’s Pastor could be non-living humans, but books – the Bible and Science and Health?

And of course, It would no longer appear on my email.  He said it could be done, and sure enough it worked very well for 1 week. She was able to read all the daily news, incl. in depth news. Now, for some unknown reason she no longer gets it, and she is asked to subscribe for it.  Myself, however, still get the CS Monitor news.

I had been invited on the Ingraham Angle (https://video.foxnews.com/v/6068772140001/?mc_cid=de8e89edf3&mc_eid=[UNIQID]#sp=show-clips) to talk about my CNN appearance and upcoming book, A Dream Derailed (http://adreamderailed.com/?mc_cid=de8e89edf3&mc_eid=[UNIQID]) . But the violence in Chicago and the mass murders in Dayton and El Paso were as much on the host's mind as my own.  So when she asked me - as someone who has worked in the inner city - what these cities need, I said:  ""Chicago needs spiritual leadership. Politicians cannot solve these kinds of problems. It's our families, and our ministers, and our communities that must come together to address these issues.""  (You can watch my interview below or on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEb7-cGxtVM&mc_cid=de8e89edf3&mc_eid=[UNIQID]) .)  What I wanted people to understand is that looking to politicians to solve such problems is futile. Not only does it pass on both responsibility and blame, but it's unfair. Politicians don't have the power to fix something so fundamental. They can only address things at the edges, once law gets involved. But how to do you stop a problem before it starts? That isn't a political issue. That's a spiritual one.  After my interview with Laura, a dear friend shared with me a few words from other ministers who have been spreading the same message (https://onenewsnow.com/culture/2019/08/07/you-kick-god-out-of-the-culture-this-is-what-you-get?mc_cid=de8e89edf3&mc_eid=[UNIQID]) . Abraham Hamilton III recently spoke on American Family Radio about how we are ""mis-educating"" people to devalue life. He said:  ""We have a generation [now] that has been force-fed, through their mis-education systems, the message that they're nothing but animals; [that] there's nothing unique or sacred about human life – [and therefore] life has no purpose, no meaning. That is what society has force-fed a generation. ...  You kick God out of society – the God who says 'You were made in My image' and that life is precious – you reject Him [and] expel Him from society; yet want to complain when people act like animals. We can't have it both ways."" Dr. James Dobson is a friend and supporter of CAAP who has given us great insight and help. He recently wrote about the growth of socialism in our country and how this political mindset alienates us from God. In a letter that he urged us to share (https://drjamesdobson.org/about/august-newsletter-2019?sc=hpslider1&mc_cid=de8e89edf3&mc_eid=[UNIQID]) with others, he quoted a sermon from Dr. Jack Graham:  ""Socialism is fundamentally contradictory to the Christian worldview. It seeks to suppress all people, especially Christians, in favor of the state. And the way that it does that is by breaking down the institutions that God has established, particularly marriage and the family. When I see the breakdown of our culture, our society, and especially the family, it truly breaks my heart. There is a spiritual war going on all around us. It is a battle for the heart and soul of our nation. We are fighting for the sanctity of life, the sacredness of biblical marriage, sexual identity, religious freedom, and, yes, economic freedom that gives us the ability to prosper within a nation. Socialism opposes each of these cornerstones."" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEb7-cGxtVM&mc_cid=de8e89edf3&mc_eid=[UNIQID]  To put it bluntly, we are missing God in our homes, neighborhood, schools, and culture. We are missing both the discipline and hope that come with prayer. We are losing our understanding of the sanctity of all human life and the respect for life that flows from that principle.  We are losing what it means to be a neighborhood or community. These are not ways to describe geographic proximity. They're statements about how we look out for each other, share values, and ensure the betterment of the next generation.  Our country is losing touch with God.  How did this happen? How do we fix it? These are some of the questions I wrestle with in my upcoming book. Though it's not yet on sale, we are giving a ""thank you"" copy to donors who gift CAAP $30 or become a sponsor of the book for $100. To learn more, visit the book's website (http://adreamderailed.com/?mc_cid=de8e89edf3&mc_eid=[UNIQID]) , or just go to the donation page. (https://caapusa.org/2019/07/get-a-signed-copy-of-a-dream-derailed/?mc_cid=de8e89edf3&mc_eid=[UNIQID])  We live in an increasingly secular society, one that has turned away from the lessons of the Bible. If we want to change things, we need to put God back in our culture. Remember Matthew 24:12: Because of the increase of wickedness, the love of most will grow cold.

5000g000028bMv2AAE,You might want to see this - great opportunity to be a part of the Animal Protection Expo in GA,"Hello Patrik, We met briefly at an animal related event some time ago and I thought you would like to know about an important event. I would love for you to consider being involved with the 21st Annual Animal Protection Conference & Expo coming up on October 18-20th at The Hotel at Avalon in Alpharetta, Georgia. This is a unique conference gathers all those who are involved in pets, animal protection, and animal services. It is supported by people like you - becoming a Sponsor helps us provide amazing education for those involved in Animal Welfare. We expect 500-700 attendees consisting of veterinarians, attorneys, animal shelter, animal rescue/foster, animal behaviorist professionals, law enforcement, prosecutors, judges, lawmakers, animal advocates, trainers, pet services and business.   We are also partnering, for the first time, with the Georgia Veterinary Medical Association and their Vet South conference at the Hotel Avalon (a destination in itself - eat, work, shop & play complex). By partnering with Vet South, more attendees will be visiting our Expo area and exhibit halls.   You can also become an Exhibitor! We have 6'x3' tables and 10'x10' exhibit space available in our Expo area. Set-up a table or booth and get your organization or business right in front of new potential customers.   Also, you can get in front of this important audience by taking out an ad in our Expo Program Booklet - we have business card ads up to a full page ads available.

U-Haul and Storage Plus are striving to benefit the environment through sustainability initiatives. Truck sharing is a core U-Haul sustainability business practice that allows individuals to access a fleet of trucks that is larger than what they could access on an individual basis.  Every U-Haul truck placed in a community helps keep 19 personally owned large-capacity vehicles, pickups, SUVs and vans off the road. Fewer vehicles means less traffic congestion, less pollution, less fuel burned and cleaner air.  Storage Plus is a great place to become U-Haul Famous®. Take your picture in front of a U-Haul product, send it in and your face could land on the side of a U-Haul truck.

Cory Booker (D-NJ) had one very strong idea of who was to blame for Saturday’s back-to-back mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio.  Donald Trump.  And they say that it’s Trump who is repsonsibel for the division in this country?  Please.  This is truly sick.  “I believe in my faith there’s a saying that you reap what you sow,” Booker declared (oh, sure, pretend to be a Christian while blaming POTUS and not the man who actually decided to pick up a weapon and slaugter dozens of people).  “And Donald Trump has been sowing this kind of hatred in our country when he talks about invasions and infestations and shit-hole countries when he tells people to go back, he is responsible and sowing these kinds of divisions to hate mongers, in fact failing to even condemn them where we saw in Charlottesville where he talks about there being good people on both sides,” he went on.  “And so I believe this president is responsible,” Booker declared.  “In fact, I believe presidents should take responsibility, and his words have been fueling white supremacy and giving license to them, and we’re seeing the horrific results of hatred today. I also want to say he’s responsible to do something substantive about this problem in terms of not just his rhetoric but the actions he’s supporting. He’s done nothing to keep these weapons of mass destruction out of people who want to do horrific harm, and that, too, is responsibility that lies at his feet.”  This, coming from a man who is using a mass shooting, less than 24 hours after the gunman pulled the trigger, to draw on his own political talking points on national TV.  “The president has been a moral failure,” Mr. Morality continued.  “He has sown the seeds we are seeing now become this harvest of hate. He is responsible. He is a problem in this nation that is driving so much of this hatred. And if we can’t just clearly say that, I don’t care if you’re Republican or Democrat, when the president of the United States is using that kind of hateful language, if you are silent in that, you are complicit of the problem. If you don’t think, have a prognosis demonize people, calling them invaders, calling people infestation, if you cannot see that that rhetoric is contributing to the violence and hate in our country, then you are unfit to serve,” he declared.  “This is a moral moment in America. It’s not about party. This is about moral clarity. And it is time for us to call it like it is. This president is contributing to a climate of hate in our country, which we see, unfortunately, being punctuated by hateful violence and he has to take responsibility for that. If not, we must remove him from that office,” he continued.",8/8/2019 0:00,CSM,CSM.com,Junk,,,FALSE,

Le Conseil de l’Entente dévoile sa proposition pour lutter contre le terrorisme dans ses Etats membres; 2. Le HCRRUN met en garde les fraudeurs qui compromettent le processus d’indemnisation; 3. La CNDH lance les activités du Mécanisme national de prévention de la torture au Togo;  Image   Le Conseil de l’Entente dévoile sa proposition pour lutter contre le terrorisme dans ses Etats membres  Lomé, le 06 Août 2019-  La 16ème réunion ordinaire du Comité des experts des 5 pays membres du Conseil de l’Entente (Bénin, Burkina Faso, Côte d’ivoire, Niger Togo) a pris fin le lundi 5 août 2019 à Lomé.  Débutée le vendredi 2 août dernier, cette rencontre a permis aux participants d’examiner les comptes arrêtés au 31 décembre 2018 et définir de nouvelles perspectives pour l’organisation. A cette occasion, le Secrétaire exécutif du Conseil de l'Entente, Patrice Kouamé a présenté son rapport d’activité au Comité des experts dans différents domaines.  Entre autres, dans le secteur de la coopération politique avec l’observation des élections et dans le secteur de la sécurité, avec la proposition d’un nouveau mécanisme dénommé : « Mécanisme d’entente de renseignement », qui vise à lutter contre le terrorisme.  Parlant du compte financier, les Commissaires aux comptes ont estimé que lesdits comptes ont été fidèles à la situation actuelle du Conseil. « Pratiquement, plus de 90% du budget ont été consommés », ont-ils indiqué à cette occasion. A préciser qu’entre le 1er janvier et le 31 mai 2019, il est noté une trésorerie de plus de 3 milliards de FCFA alors que les créances des Etats sont estimées à 2,5 milliards de F CFA.  Selon Patrice Kwame, le comité a aussi pris connaissance du rapport provisoire de l’étude relative à l’élaboration d’une stratégie de promotion des activités génératrices de revenus et créatrices d’emplois pour les jeunes et les femmes de l’espace.  Sa mise en œuvre a-t-il dit, permettra au Conseil de l’entente de disposer de statistiques pertinentes sur la situation de la jeunesse et des femmes et d’appréhender les causes et les conséquences du chômage et du sous-emploi des jeunes, afin de trouver des solutions pérennes.  La future stratégie fera des propositions aux pays en matière de lutte contre la migration des jeunes. La stratégie dont l’étude sera renforcée par deux consultants sera enfin fondée sur le modèle du Centre Régional de Formation pour l’Entretien Routier (CERFER), un établissement de référence aujourd’hui dans la sous-région.  Abordant la question sécuritaire au sein des pays membre du Conseil, le comité des experts a condamné fermement les attaques terroristes perpétrées au Bénin, au Burkina-Faso et au Niger. Il a eu à exprimer sa compassion à ces Etats et présenter les condoléances aux familles des victimes tout en souhaitant un prompt rétablissement aux blessés.  Notons qu’en marge des travaux, des récompenses ont été remises au trois gagnants du concours, meilleur jeune entrepreneur organisé dans le cadre de la 25ème édition de la tranche commune entente dont le tirage avait eu lieu à Lomé. Chacun des lauréats a reçu au cours de la session de Lomé, un chèque de 5 millions de franc CFA.  Image  Le HCRRUN met en garde les fraudeurs qui compromettent le processus d’indemnisation  Lomé, le 06 Août 2019-  Le Haut-commissariat à la réconciliation et au renforcement de l’unité nationale (HCRRUN) a annoncé le lundi 5 août 2019 à travers un communiqué, avoir constaté des fraudes, qui mettent à mal le bon déroulement de ses opérations d’indemnisations.  Ces fraudes sont orchestrées par certains responsables et agents des préfectures et tribunaux qui délivrent, « sur la base de fausses informations, des documents à des victimes moyennant paiement d’un pourcentage variant entre 5 et 10% du montant de l’indemnité », a indiqué le HCRRUN dans son communiqué.  Si les fraudeurs ont pu être démasqués, l’institution présidée par Awa Nana Daboya informe que « désormais, ces stratagèmes délictueux seront portés à la connaissance du public et leurs auteurs répondront de leurs actes devant la justice ».  Cette annonce du HCRRUN intervient alors que le processus d’indemnisation des victimes de 2005 a repris depuis le 22 juillet dernier dans les Régions des Plateaux, Centrale et de la Kara. Jusqu’au 10 août, les victimes recensées par le HCRRUN dans ces régions obtiendront leur part d’indemnisations.  Elles (les victimes) bénéficieront non seulement de la prise en charge médicale et psychologique dont les frais seront entièrement assurés par le HCRRUN, mais également d’une indemnité financière conformément au montant fixé par la Commission Vérité Justice et Réconciliation (CVJR).  Pour rappel, le programme d’indemnisation des victimes des violences sociopolitiques de 1958 à 2005 au Togo est l’une des recommandations formulées par la Commission Vérité Justice et Réconciliation (CVJR). Le gouvernement y a déjà alloué une enveloppe de 5 milliards FCFA pour cette deuxième phase qui a débuté depuis le 27 novembre 2018.  Image   La CNDH lance les activités du Mécanisme national de prévention de la torture au Togo   Lomé, le 06 Août 2019-   Le 20 juillet 2010, le Togo a ratifié le protocole facultatif à la convention contre la torture. Ce traité lui fait obligation de mettre en place un Mécanisme national de prévention de la torture (MNPT). Ainsi, le gouvernement a donc choisi de confier la tâche à la Commission nationale de droit de l’homme (CNDH).  C’est dans cette perspective que la CNDH a procédé le lundi 5 août 2019 à Lomé, au lancement des activités d’un projet d’appui à l’opérationnalisation dudit Mécanisme. Ce projet sera exécuté par la CNDH en collaboration avec le Collectif des Associations Contre l’Impunité au Togo (CACIT). Le Mécanisme consiste à effectuer des visites régulières dans les lieux de détention afin d’examiner la situation des détenus.  Des séances de formation sont aussi prévues pour le renfoncement des capacités des différents acteurs notamment, les agents de la justice, les corps habillés, les organisations de la société civile ainsi que les membres de la CNDH.  L’objectif est d’outiller ces acteurs de la chaine pénales sur les rudiments nécessaires pour mieux prévenir la torture et autres peines ou traitements cruels, inhumains ou dégradants dans les lieux de privation de liberté.  « Le mécanisme consiste à faire des visites régulières et inopinées dans les lieux de détention. Ceci, dans le but de prévenir la torture sous toutes ses formes. Pour ce faire, les participants sont invités à plus d'assiduité afin d'assimiler les thématiques inscrites à l'agenda, notamment, les instruments de prévention de la torture, le MNP et son fonctionnement, la responsabilité des acteurs dans les lieux de privation de liberté », a précisé la présidente de la CNDH, Nakpa Polo.  Le représentant du Ministre en charge des Droits de l'Homme, Komlan Narteh-Messan, n'a pas manqué d'exprimer la reconnaissance du gouvernement à la CNDH. Le gouvernement, a-t-il dit, mesure à sa juste valeur la portée du soutien que chaque acteur devra apporter à la Commission dans son combat contre la torture et autres mauvais traitements, en particulier et pour l'enracinement des droits de l'Homme en général au Togo.  Précisons que la mise en œuvre de ce Mécanisme s’inscrit dans le cadre des engagements pris par le gouvernement devant le Comité des nations unies de lutte contre la torture, d’améliorer les conditions de détention des prévenus au Togo.

But to use an American baseball metaphor, the August 12th Sentinel is a homerun! Geoffry Hibb’s cover article on “The beauty of moderation” is so helpful in pointing out that we can challenge extreme thoughts about exercise, diet, and life/work balance.  I also loved Mark Swinney’s article “Are we independent thinkers?” and the healing he experienced from challenging matter-based thinking. And George Moffett’s article “Taking the time to listen to his voice” was deeply healing and much-needed in these times of constant distractions. It seems that a theme running though every article was about true Spirit-based thinking.  No wonder that Mary Baker Eddy wrote on the very first page of Science and Health, with Key to the Scriptures “The time for thinkers has come.”  Comment Publication *  I give permission to publish my comment.

5000g000028bLPzAAM,"Is delaying menopause necessary, or even a good idea?","Stephanie????, I have a story that Modern Parenthood???? may want to cover.  Many women approach menopause with a mixture of dread and relief. As menstruation and ovulation (and the chance of conception) exit, menopause symptoms like hot flashes, night sweats, weight gain and memory loss usually arrive.  So, when it was announced a few days ago that physicians in England performed a procedure that could delay menopause by up to 20 years, many people are asking for clarity on the exact benefits of this bit of modern medicine.  Physicians in Birmingham, England performed this procedure on 10 British women ranging in age from 22 to 36:  · A portion of a patient’s ovaries are removed, and the tissue is then cryogenically frozen. · Later, when approaching menopause, doctors thaw and re-implant the tissue, restoring the patient’s younger, natural hormones.  Board-certified fertility specialist Mark Trolice, M.D. said that ovarian tissue reimplantation has the potential to restore ovulation and extend fertility until the newly implanted ovarian tissue egg number is depleted.  The British physicians say they developed this procedure to delay the onset of menopause-related issues like osteoporosis and heart conditions.  Dr. Trolice said that it could, in theory, prolong fertility well beyond menopause, which occurs on average at age 51.  However, delaying menopause doesn’t mean anyone is aging backwards—the pregnancy risks associated with maternal age remain.  And for women who find menstruating for 30 to 40 years to be long enough, delaying menopause might seem a bit ridiculous.   “While I applaud the investigators in their pursuit for safer and more natural management of hormone regulation in women who will be naturally facing menopause, it is dubious these women will desire 25 to 30 additional years of pregnancy risk, contraception or periods,” Dr. Trolice said.  Mark Trolice, M.D (https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/wf/click?upn=G62jSYfZdO-2F12d8lSllQB5XdBYAL3LRYS6ByxFsQrFR1Q2tSoGQ-2BbliHhdkw3zVL_6pchHAirW10eM8b14ZAlkZkRllITHdt0G4CIxpgEX-2FYMT-2FVtvkhkoxOwXdc140hQDKip1v9w6NG6f4yMNdzd3I0JbBoOspHl9BOjIgd0xs3Hindq6qSO1V03Jd-2B9a7so8Pwm052CwQbgUl-2B7J-2BxPbPAx7-2F7HKkwS6zlTlKylKkbMYvsM0-2FNS62F06D4OXAOtBgQ2RamGneeX6cGxyCbWrMUI4pLhTX-2BpYsYEC-2Fk4keZTT3DNn9kSGRtD5VaAGItW-2B-2BU0I-2F57cjlFi4edfWPaJSqXHt8HKEaRPPgTOFAcDefd8NfKUPeU5DIityQkzyiaxALMJ7sF6yvCk9I1K-2Fku6v27ojtUSGob0B1-2BOC46IIY-3D . directs Fertility CARE (https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/wf/click?upn=G62jSYfZdO-2F12d8lSllQB-2BfRABnwnYhMjeCCX0kgi0NTRjzAu6v-2FnP4EJvk7-2FLo0_6pchHAirW10eM8b14ZAlkZkRllITHdt0G4CIxpgEX-2FYMT-2FVtvkhkoxOwXdc140hQDKip1v9w6NG6f4yMNdzd3I0JbBoOspHl9BOjIgd0xs3Hindq6qSO1V03Jd-2B9a7so8Pwm052CwQbgUl-2B7J-2BxPbPAx7-2F7HKkwS6zlTlKylKkbMYvsM0-2FNS62F06D4OXAOtBgQ2RamGneeX6cGxyCbWrN-2BOSS6mCwhDwDqSjIwHB5pu0eKnKBdreBgdRlY5kI28axST5Om6Ok6e8Iz7HaHcXgV8EtfsUNqZuBeM50RFEpT1rWwDQwjehPdnx3YYyJ3o7IvAIGUVyp43FrILMNwq4rXGd9zsYdclfuhLPZO973s-3D (Center of Assisted Reproduction & Endocrinology) in Winter Park, Fla. and clinical associate professor in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the University of Central Florida College of Medicine in Orlando, Fla.

5000g000028bXZCAA2,Editorial comments and corrections,"The following information was collected:  Name: John  Email: robledoint@yahoo.com  Subscriber: No  Subject: Ocasio-Cortez Next target.... the democratic party!?  Product: csmonitor.com  Message:  Ocasio-Cortez’ next target… the Democratic Party!? AUGUST 9, 2019 LINKEDIN TWITTER There’s a coup taking place in the Democratic party as radicals like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., seize control — and they’re trying to chase out anyone with even remotely moderate views.  And by next election, the Democrats could be in shambles, wondering what went wrong!  The same far-left socialist “progressives” that helped send Ocasio-Cortez to Washington are hoping to repeat that success.  Sponsored: “Know-it all” scientists EMBARRASSED by Army vet  As with Ocasio-Cortez, that formula doesn’t begin with running against a Republican.  It begins by attacking a fellow Democrat!  The far-left Justice Democrats – which backed Ocasio-Cortez as well as fellow “Squad” representatives Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., and Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., in 2016 – just endorsed three new candidates for Congress.  And in two of those cases, they endorsed far-left candidates to take on already seated Democratic members of Congress, just as Ocasio-Cortez did when she unseated longtime Rep. Joseph Crowley, D-N.Y., in a primary challenge.  In this case, the group backed Alex Morse, who is launching a primary challenge against Rep. Richard Neal, D-Mass., and Morgan Harper, who is primarying Rep. Joyce Beatty (D-Ohio).  Neal, in particular, would be a major target; he’s served since 1989 and is chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, often considered one of the most powerful committees in Congress because of its budget control.  Sponsored: However, Neal has angered the far left for supposedly not going far enough or moving fast enough in demanding President Donald Trump’s tax returns.  That’s a weakness the Justice Democrats now hope to exploit.  The third candidate, Kara Eastman, will seek to run against Don Bacon, R-Neb.  And all three have had to embrace the Justice Democrat platform, vowing to support a far-left socialist agenda that includes abolishing the healthcare system as we know it.  Instead of private health insurance and a system incentivized by a free market, they back a “Medicare for all” plan that economists believe could be disastrous to both healthcare in general as well as to the economy as a whole.  They also pledge to back the radical Green New Deal, which could restrict, tax or even ban everything from cars to air travel to hamburgers.  Sponsored: The group’s candidates also want to make college education free, open the borders and even open up prisons to allow many offenders out (as well as decriminalizing many offenses).  But there is also good news for conservatives hidden in this.  Two pieces of good news, to be precise.  First, the party’s internal civil war means it is difficult if not impossible for them to function – which could help ensure the radical agenda fails in Congress.  That’s already visible now as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. struggles — and often fails – to keep her conference unified.  And second, while leftists may be able to beat entrenched politicians in primaries, where few people turn out, they don’t do quite as well in actual elections, when Americans often reject extremists.  Sponsored: How to restore your memory in 1 hour  In fact, the overall Justice Democrats record is downright dreadful.  In 2018, the group endorsed 79 candidates in primaries. Just 26 of them won, or had a success rate of less than 1 in 3.  But it gets worse: Of those 26, just seven won seats in Congress, a success rate of just 9 percent.  And it gets worse still, as exactly NONE of their endorsed candidates running in essential “swing” districts won, proving that extremist views can’t win in the most important races of all.  That means Republican candidates lining up against far-left Justice Democrats in Congressional races could have an easier time winning their own elections… and help ensure that they take back the House in 2020.  — Walter W.

(August 8, 2019) — To encourage kids and families to get outdoors and explore nature the National Wildlife Federation is proud to team up with Dora and the Lost City of Gold – in partnership with Paramount Pictures and Walden Media. Featuring a majority-Latino cast, the film represents the vital role that wildlife, nature, and family play in Hispanic and Latino cultures, while inspiring kids from all backgrounds to go outdoors and build a lifelong love of nature and wildlife.  “Dora inspires millions of children to explore nature and connect with wildlife. As parents and caretakers, it is our responsibility to help children appreciate our natural resources and provide them with opportunities to get outside every day and discover the amazing natural wonders all around them,” said Collin O’Mara (https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/wf/click?upn=G62jSYfZdO-2F12d8lSllQByFMfRk-2FmqglOdsFdkDuF8un3xtvjMneZ1yQXg7M4F5uv0z5JszWOPVI5EhnDPzHTg-3D-3D_6pchHAirW10eM8b14ZAlkZkRllITHdt0G4CIxpgEX-2FYMT-2FVtvkhkoxOwXdc140hQDKip1v9w6NG6f4yMNdzd3I0JbBoOspHl9BOjIgd0xs2fddw0YacdqQrItOEmHZuh-2B2lirh-2FRRqmOz-2FnQermRWHF0ysaopwuf4TGhm2I59Y21UWjMJ6vh-2FY5DBOAB-2BGJisJ5P8Ew8UQBhpZTfBejgZ9WKMwA5JpBvqcF9TabsyZ6hbvYeCASpXTFUHtuhy0dfMopC8gds6bXbnEMonlFsE-2B-2BbGBm8O-2FSjdJEcX4-2BygkZl2GyfXqcR9xGHElKELANsiUjVeZ1-2B9v99-2FjfpBLNNlWnxZOnsPWWZbrjpRrAM-2Bdo-3D , president and CEO of the National Wildlife Federation. “We at the National Wildlife Federation are thrilled to partner with Paramount Pictures and Walden Media to connect more kids with wildlife and the outdoors through Dora and the Lost City of Gold (https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/wf/click?upn=G62jSYfZdO-2F12d8lSllQBya3aKQC15-2BL5bdHuFl280cXXqa3sNGtcyeB-2FRVPo5LG_6pchHAirW10eM8b14ZAlkZkRllITHdt0G4CIxpgEX-2FYMT-2FVtvkhkoxOwXdc140hQDKip1v9w6NG6f4yMNdzd3I0JbBoOspHl9BOjIgd0xs2fddw0YacdqQrItOEmHZuh-2B2lirh-2FRRqmOz-2FnQermRWHF0ysaopwuf4TGhm2I59Y21UWjMJ6vh-2FY5DBOAB-2BGJisJ5P8Ew8UQBhpZTfBejgZ5HaCHI-2FQOD1ntvUui5kbuBiS-2BKZeUXiJi-2Fw-2BexuUeeSdN-2BU6KoZPJYKnRzK-2FLTFcwPtRqfBywOkKfJLSVMbZrTZw-2BF2HR2-2F-2FLq4V37By-2BLMaDB80mvTzMfT-2FOSSZdcDhAqAPwxBFXRUS-2F9SMn0KMjY-3D , an inspiring movie that brilliantly highlights the benefits of nature for our younger generations and their families.”  “Our country has so many places to explore — from neighborhood parks to our National Parks and Forests, Wildlife Refuges, and over 245 million acres of public lands across the United States.

5000g000028bTspAAE,Editorial comments and corrections,"The following information was collected:  Name: General Kelly  Email: operation.removal.djt@navy.gov  Subscriber: No  Subject: Is US doomed?  Product: csmonitor.com  Message: US is on the brink of massive civil unrest in 2019 Observe the sequence, the roiling pattern of the American political condition, the descending scale: From unity and consensus, to hard-edged partisanship, to intense polarization, to tribalism. What’s next? Does the continuum lead to widespread unrest, violence in the streets? With an increasingly unmoored President purposely stoking divisions for perceived political gain, the possibility need well be contemplated. The work of Donald Trump was less threatening to the public order when the Democrats were relatively passive. But the resistance to the bottom-feeding Oval Office occupant took on a new fervour this past week with Congresswoman Maxine Waters, rage in her voice, urging followers to confront Republican lawmakers in restaurants, department stores, gas stations. She appeared to be advocating public clashes: “Tell them they’re not welcome any more, anywhere.” In the wake of their policy of separating families at the Mexican border, other top Republicans were denounced in the public square. Mr. Trump responded to Ms. Waters, calling her “an extraordinarily low IQ person.” Of her desire to confront members of his administration, Mr. Trump said, “Be careful what you wish for, Max!” He once advised supporters at a rally to “knock the crap out of” protesters. There are more detonations that could be set off by his push to blow up the international trading system. His preparedness to ignore Constitutional norms is apparent. His willingness to see the system as rigged and wage war against the so-called deep state is clear. A wild President invites any number of wild scenarios. Civil conflict, the likes of which the United States has not seen in decades, is not out of the question.",8/8/2019 0:00,CSM,CSM.com,Junk,,,FALSE,

Celebrates Lifelong Love, Music And The Wonderful World Of Canines  **Austin, TX, August 8, 2019** — Retired music professor and accomplished musician Robert Freeman shares reflections of his 42-year marriage, their 17 canine companions and his remarkable career as an educator in WOOF!  A Love Story of Dogs, Music, and Life.  Freeman was a music school director when he fell in love with his assistant, Carol. Throughout their union they created a loving home for 17 dogs, all of which are featured through striking photography between the covers of Woof! This book is a celebration of true love — between people and between people and animals — and beautifully relates the eternal truth that the world would be a better place if everyone simply took good care of each other.  Author Robert Freeman is a musicologist, Steinway artist, and a professional musician. Over 42 years of marriage to his wife, Carol, he has been the proud master of 17 dogs — 11 of them golden retrievers, six of them American dogs. Having made tenure at MIT, he directed the Eastman School of Music for 24 years, presided over the New England Conservatory for three, and served as dean of the College of Fine Arts at the University of Texas in Austin for seven.

5000g000028bWwxAAE,Protect Children's Religious Right to Go to School in MA,"Oppose H.3999 - A Discriminatory Bill for a Child's Right to an Education in MA, by Removing Religious Exemptions  https://www.gopetition.com/petitions/oppose-h3999-a-discriminatory-bill-for-a-childs-right-to-an-eductaion-by-removing-relgious-exemptions.html   Target:Massachusetts Public Health CommitteeRegion:United States of America <https://www.gopetition.com/petition-campaigns/united-states-of-america> Website:www.righttoaneducation.com  On 5/31/2019 Representative Andres X. Vargas filed a bill 'An Act relative to vaccinations and public health' which if passed, would remove the right to religious exemption from vaccination for school children.  In Massachusetts, the law provides that every child deserves a public education without discrimination on the basis of race, color, sex, gender identity, religion, national origin, sexual orientation or disability. Andres Vargas’ proposed elimination of the religious exemption for vaccination is deeply discriminatory, unwarranted and unnecessary.  MA has achieved one of the highest rates of vaccination in the country without coercive means and exceeds levels for herd immunity. There is no public health crisis. There is unlikely to be a public health threat from vaccine preventable illness, given the high rates of vaccination. Furthermore, Massachusetts code already provides for protocols to prevent the spread of communicable illness, through the use of quarantine and temporary school exclusion.  So what does Andres Vargas’s proposed legislation accomplish, given that there is no significant public health threat from communicable illness? It will marginalize children based on their parent’s religious beliefs and exclude children from a public education. This will be true, even if a parent declines just one vaccine. Furthermore, it unfairly targets those from socioeconomically disadvantaged communities and those from the special needs community, who do not have reasonable alternatives to public education and who depend on public education to counter institutionalized bias and afford equal opportunity, equity and justice.  Massachusetts should continue to lead the way in creative public health solutions to significant public health problems, like the opioid crisis and the rise of mental health issues. We should not needlessly impinge on religious civil liberties and create more public health issues by excluding children from necessary educational and therapeutic services.  Our country was founded on the premise of universal civil liberties. Massachusetts should continue to be a leader in the defense and preservation of those sacred liberties.  We, the undersigned, call on the Massachusetts Joint Committee on Public Health to vote in opposition of H.3999.     - Sign the petition    <https://www.gopetition.com/petitions/oppose-h3999-a-discriminatory-bill-for-a-childs-right-to-an-eductaion-by-removing-relgious-exemptions.html#sign>    - Sponsor    <https://www.gopetition.com/petitions/oppose-h3999-a-discriminatory-bill-for-a-childs-right-to-an-eductaion-by-removing-relgious-exemptions.html#sponsor>   Select your country or region United States of America Australia Canada United Kingdom ------------------- Afghanistan Africa Akrotiri and Dhekelia Åland Albania Algeria American Samoa Andorra Angola Anguilla Antarctica Antigua and Barbuda Argentina Armenia Aruba Ascension Island Asia Australia Austria Azerbaijan Bahamas Bahrain Bangladesh Barbados Belarus Belgium Belize Benin Bermuda Bhutan Bolivia Bosnia and Herzegovina Botswana Bouvet Island Brazil British Indian Ocean Territory British Virgin Islands Brunei Bulgaria Burkina Faso Burma (Myanmar) Burundi Cambodia Cameroon Canada Cape Verde Caribbean Cayman Islands Central African Republic Central America Chad Chile China Christmas Island Cocos Islands Colombia Comoros Cook Islands Costa Rica Côte d'Ivoire Croatia Cuba Curaçao Cyprus Czech Republic D.R. of the Congo Denmark Dhekelia Djibouti Dominica Dominican Republic East Timor Ecuador Egypt El Salvador England Equatorial Guinea Eritrea Estonia Ethiopia Europe Falkland Islands Faroe Islands Fiji Finland France French Guiana French Polynesia French Southern Territories Gabon Gambia Georgia Germany Ghana Gibraltar Greece Greenland Grenada Guadeloupe Guam Guatemala Guernsey Guinea Guinea-Bissau Guyana Haiti Heard and McDonald Islands Honduras Hong Kong Hungary Iceland India Indonesia Iran Iraq Ireland Isle of Man Israel Italy Ivory Coast Jamaica Japan Jersey Jordan Kazakhstan Kenya Kiribati Kosovo Kuwait Kyrgyzstan Laos Latvia Lebanon Lesotho Liberia Libya Liechtenstein Lithuania  Luxembourg Macau Macedonia, Republic of Madagascar Malawi Malaysia Maldives  Mali Malta Marshall Islands Martinique Mauritania Mauritius Mayotte Mexico Micronesia, Federated States of Middle East Moldova Monaco Mongolia Montenegro Montserrat Morocco Mozambique Myanmar Nagorno-Karabakh Namibia Nauru Nepal Netherlands Netherlands Antilles New Caledonia New Zealand Nicaragua Niger Nigeria Niue Norfolk Island North Korea Northern Cyprus Northern Ireland Northern Mariana Islands Norway Oman Pakistan Palau Palestinian territories Panama Papua New Guinea Paraguay Peru Philippines Pitcairn Island Poland Portugal Puerto Rico Qatar Republic of the Congo Reunion Romania Russia Rwanda S.

I had been invited on the Ingraham Angle (https://video.foxnews.com/v/6068772140001/?mc_cid=de8e89edf3&mc_eid=[UNIQID]#sp=show-clips) to talk about my CNN appearance and upcoming book, A Dream Derailed (http://adreamderailed.com/?mc_cid=de8e89edf3&mc_eid=[UNIQID]) . But the violence in Chicago and the mass murders in Dayton and El Paso were as much on the host's mind as my own.  So when she asked me - as someone who has worked in the inner city - what these cities need, I said:  ""Chicago needs spiritual leadership. Politicians cannot solve these kinds of problems. It's our families, and our ministers, and our communities that must come together to address these issues.""  (You can watch my interview below or on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEb7-cGxtVM&mc_cid=de8e89edf3&mc_eid=[UNIQID]) .)  What I wanted people to understand is that looking to politicians to solve such problems is futile. Not only does it pass on both responsibility and blame, but it's unfair. Politicians don't have the power to fix something so fundamental. They can only address things at the edges, once law gets involved. But how to do you stop a problem before it starts? That isn't a political issue. That's a spiritual one.  After my interview with Laura, a dear friend shared with me a few words from other ministers who have been spreading the same message (https://onenewsnow.com/culture/2019/08/07/you-kick-god-out-of-the-culture-this-is-what-you-get?mc_cid=de8e89edf3&mc_eid=[UNIQID]) . Abraham Hamilton III recently spoke on American Family Radio about how we are ""mis-educating"" people to devalue life. He said:  ""We have a generation [now] that has been force-fed, through their mis-education systems, the message that they're nothing but animals; [that] there's nothing unique or sacred about human life – [and therefore] life has no purpose, no meaning. That is what society has force-fed a generation. ...  You kick God out of society – the God who says 'You were made in My image' and that life is precious – you reject Him [and] expel Him from society; yet want to complain when people act like animals. We can't have it both ways."" Dr. James Dobson is a friend and supporter of CAAP who has given us great insight and help. He recently wrote about the growth of socialism in our country and how this political mindset alienates us from God. In a letter that he urged us to share (https://drjamesdobson.org/about/august-newsletter-2019?sc=hpslider1&mc_cid=de8e89edf3&mc_eid=[UNIQID]) with others, he quoted a sermon from Dr. Jack Graham:  ""Socialism is fundamentally contradictory to the Christian worldview. It seeks to suppress all people, especially Christians, in favor of the state. And the way that it does that is by breaking down the institutions that God has established, particularly marriage and the family. When I see the breakdown of our culture, our society, and especially the family, it truly breaks my heart. There is a spiritual war going on all around us. It is a battle for the heart and soul of our nation. We are fighting for the sanctity of life, the sacredness of biblical marriage, sexual identity, religious freedom, and, yes, economic freedom that gives us the ability to prosper within a nation. Socialism opposes each of these cornerstones."" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEb7-cGxtVM&mc_cid=de8e89edf3&mc_eid=[UNIQID]  To put it bluntly, we are missing God in our homes, neighborhood, schools, and culture. We are missing both the discipline and hope that come with prayer. We are losing our understanding of the sanctity of all human life and the respect for life that flows from that principle.  We are losing what it means to be a neighborhood or community. These are not ways to describe geographic proximity. They're statements about how we look out for each other, share values, and ensure the betterment of the next generation.  Our country is losing touch with God.  How did this happen? How do we fix it? These are some of the questions I wrestle with in my upcoming book.

5000g000028bQAGAA2,Press Release - Changing how we treat land “vital” in fight against climate change – UN development chief reacts to new climate report,"Image       Changing how we treat land “vital” in fight against climate change – UN development chief reacts to new climate report  New York, August, 8 – The UN Development Programme (UNDP) Administrator Achim Steiner today joined international climate experts in calling for action following the release of a UN report on the devastating impacts of current land use practices on the climate.  “Unless we make bold changes in the way we produce our food and manage our land, we will not be able to cut emissions sufficiently and keep global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius,” says Achim Steiner, UNDP Administrator. “The IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) report clearly demonstrates how critical sustainable land management is for climate action and for human well-being.”  The IPCC Special Report on Climate Change and Land, released Thursday 8 August, cautioned the global community to stop the irresponsible exploitation of the planet’s natural resources, or reach a point of no return in the climate crisis.  Agriculture, forestry, and land use changes are responsible for about 23 percent of global greenhouse emissions. Reducing global emissions therefore requires not only radical changes in the transport and energy sector, but also in land use. Natural land processes absorb carbon dioxide equivalent to almost a third of carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels and industry.  “This transformation will not be easy,” says Steiner, “but it is necessary and it is possible. The solutions are at hand. Now we must scale them globally to work towards a zero carbon, climate-resilient future.”  Elsewhere, the report finds that about one third of food production is lost or wasted, and that climate change will increasingly affect food security.  Working to eliminate food waste and eating a balanced diet are essential to reducing emissions from our food system. Coordinated action to address climate change can simultaneously improve land, food security and nutrition, and help to end hunger.   UNDP is working with partners to support 105 countries in protecting and restoring their natural resources. The organization supports nature-based solutions that promote sustainable land management and landscape stewardship, through integrated land use planning and management, adoption of sustainable agriculture practices and land governance approaches that build resilience of landscapes, ecosystems and communities.

He soon became one of the country’s leading forces in registering more young voters and voters of color, fighting climate change, working for racial justice, and helping secure better lives for all Americans. Tom has led a number of people-first, grassroots campaigns that have repeatedly defeated powerful special interests, beating big oil to win clean air laws, forcing big tobacco to pay its share of healthcare costs, and closing a billion-dollar corporate tax loophole to fund public schools.  Tom and his wife Kat Taylor were early signers of the Giving Pledge, a commitment to give the bulk of his fortune to good causes before they die. Tom’s dedication to doing what is right comes from his parents. His father was a lawyer who prosecuted Nazis at the Nuremberg Trials; his mother was a journalist and teacher who volunteered to teach prisoners in New York City jails. Tom says his parents showed him the power of having the courage to do the right thing. Their greatest lesson, he says, was that our actions speak louder than our words – what we do is more important than what we say.  ============================================================ Tom Steyer 2020 | P.O.

I am writing to be certain that the subscription is NOT auto-renewed and is cancelled on that date.  I have read the Monitor off and on for several years and finally decided to subscribe.  I had found the reporting, for the most part to be ""fair and balanced"", to borrow the tagline from a news source that  most certainly is not.  I have found though that the tone of the articles in the Monitor have become increasing liberal, even progressive, in their tone and presentation.  Clearly, the many of the writers have viewpoints that is creeping into their writing.  Sometimes it is nuanced, sometimes not.  I think of myself as a Libertarian but, I will admit I lean towards conservatism.  I do though,  try hard to see all sides of a discussion.   I had just finished reading the articles ""Why America's big cities have become the President's punching bag"" and ""Why El Paso is determined not to roll up the welcome mat"".  I found these articles to present a one-sided view with meager attempts to present differing viewpoints.  I found myself sitting here repeating "" but, but""   in my head.  That is when I decided I do not need to subscribe to a publication that writes with a clear bias.  I can find that anywhere without paying for it.  I guess that finding a source that is truly fair and balanced is just  too much to hope in this day and age.  My account information is below.  I would appreciate an acknowledgement that my subscription will be cancelled in October.

5000g000028bTLvAAM,Steyer Gets Third Qualifying Poll for Next DNC Debate,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: Thursday, August 8, 2019 CONTACT: press@tomsteyer.com  Steyer Gets Third Qualifying Poll for Next DNC Debate  (San Francisco, August 8, 2019) — Today, Monmouth University released its most recent polling for Iowa, that shows Tom Steyer at 3% in the crucial first state. The results put him in the top tier of candidates and one step closer to qualifying for the September DNC Debate in Houston, TX. Steyer is now polling in Iowa above a number of candidates who have been in the race much longer.  “Almost exactly one month since announcing his candidacy, Tom Steyer is now well on his way to qualifying for the third Democratic Presidential Candidate Debate stage in Houston. Steyer has been getting his message of taking back our democracy to voters all over the nation, and this poll shows voters in Iowa are starting to hear that message and agree with him,” said campaign manager Heather Hargreaves.  Tom Steyer will be traveling to Iowa this weekend to meet with voters and attend a number of community events.  Paid for by Tom Steyer 2020.  ###  About Tom:  Tom Steyer left his successful investing business seven years ago to give his own money and all his time and energy to fighting for progressive causes. He soon became one of the country’s leading forces in registering more young voters and voters of color, fighting climate change, working for racial justice, and helping secure better lives for all Americans. Tom has led a number of people-first, grassroots campaigns that have repeatedly defeated powerful special interests, beating big oil to win clean air laws, forcing big tobacco to pay its share of healthcare costs, and closing a billion-dollar corporate tax loophole to fund public schools.  Tom and his wife Kat Taylor were early signers of the Giving Pledge, a commitment to give the bulk of his fortune to good causes before they die. Tom’s dedication to doing what is right comes from his parents. His father was a lawyer who prosecuted Nazis at the Nuremberg Trials; his mother was a journalist and teacher who volunteered to teach prisoners in New York City jails. Tom says his parents showed him the power of having the courage to do the right thing. Their greatest lesson, he says, was that our actions speak louder than our words – what we do is more important than what we say.  ============================================================ Tom Steyer 2020 | P.O.

5000g000028bFZJAA2,Back To School Smells Like Teen Sweating,"Contact: Nick Heraldson  nickheraldson@gmail.com (mailto:nickheraldson@gmail.com)  443-987-0195 (tel. or text)  Students in the USA will return to classes in sweaty puddles of their own making..  Back To School Smells Like Teen Sweating  August 7, 2019 (Lake Jackson, TX) -- Summer is winding down with season ending vacations and a few more days to relax which must mean that school will start soon. While Americans are brainwashed into thinking that the last week of August is the official start of fall (pumpkin spiced lattes go on sale) the thermometer says it’s not. Millions of students, coaches, band directors, assistant directors, assistant coaches, cheerleader leaders, helicopter moms, weekend dads, grandparents, boosters and even reporters will all say the same thing; “it’s too hot for this.” The makers of SwampButt Underwear™ agree that August is not fall and yes, it is too hot. While SwampButt Underwear has no influence over the nation’s educators, calendars or the weather, it does have insight and advice to share for teens who are headed back to class this ""fall.""  Why The Heat Is Worse At School  Un-air-conditioned buses, temporary buildings, practice fields, gyms that could double as orchid nurseries and locker rooms that make Saigon seem cool and dry by comparison will be crowded with hormonal teenagers. Those same teens, whose biological changes will ooze out a real stink on even the coolest day, are all jammed together in classes and busses across the fruited plain. Many are leaving their sweaty butt prints on chairs, seats and bleachers. ""Most school busses do not come with seat belts, so air conditioning. Don't make me laugh,"" said SwampButt Underwear spokesperson and GED hopeful Nick Heraldson. ""Your students will come home all wet and cranky. Wet from the heat and sweat, cranky from trying to learn algebra.""  It's The Most Terrible Time Of The Year  For the kids who have ‘issues’ with excessive sweating the start of school is the worst time of year. It's easy enough to hide sweat in summer because everyone is sweaty, but not everyone is as sweaty once the bell rings. Middle and high school students are not particularly understanding about teen sweating or swamp butt. Although both conditions are very common, they remain largely misunderstood. There are a lot of terrible ideas for teens to manage their excessive sweating. Here are just a few of the worst.  Bad Ideas for Sweaty Teens  Wear black to hide sweat. Unless you are a devoted goth, ninja, going to or from a funeral, or prefer to be alone/dateless/un-kissed the entire school year, turning up in black everyday will draw all the wrong type of attention. Make a better fashion statement than this. Better to sweat than be ostracized or labeled something negative.  Layering clothes makes sweat harder to see. Teen agers at the north or south pole can do this, but nowhere else, especially during August and September. Putting on layers of clothes in August in the south, or practically anywhere, will make a student look like a drug mule, they are hiding a pregnancy, or stealing art supplies.  No one wants to be accused of any of those. So, wear something that looks cool that will help keep cool.  Snappy retorts. No one likes a smart ass. Saying things like, ""I may be all gross and sweaty but at least I’m not dropping my mother off at the methadone clinic like you"" may seem clever at first but not when the comedian's teeth are scattered all over the cafetorium floor. A better idea is to make jokes about yourself and your sweaty essence. Self-directed humor disarms haters and makes the joker seem approachable, well-adjusted and stable, just like all teenagers.   Make friends with other sweaty kids. No, just no. Clumping together in a clammy knot with other sticky kids is not the way to attract positive attention. The goal for most teens is to fit in and avoid negative notice. A congregation of clammy seat moisteners will spell doom for all involved. It is however the way for the soaked students to earn unfortunate nicknames for themselves or their group. Here are a few examples:   - Team Body Odor,   -  The Stank-Ems,   -  Agents of Dress Shield,   -  Puddles of Eww, etc.  Myths Debunked  Like ideas, there is a good bit of myth and folklore when it comes to teens and like most all myths and folklore it's just nonsense.   Myth: Kids and young adults are “resilient” and can deal with sweating a lot. Truth: No, they aren’t. Medical journal citations substantiate that young people are known to be significantly impacted by emotional sequelae accompanying dermatologic disease and that psychiatric issues inherently accompany dermatologic disease in children and adolescents. Studies further show that most patients with hyperhidrosis—characterized by excessive, spontaneous sweating beyond physiologic, thermal, or stress-reaction body requirements—describe their lives as “bad” or “very bad” due to the disorder. So much for resiliency.   Myth: Antiperspirants are not for underarms only. Truth: Antiperspirants are only for your underarms. Anyone who recommends that you can glide, stick, spray, and roll-on nearly anywhere that sweating is a problem (think butt cheeks, hands, feet, face, back, chest, and even groin) has never tried this. Even clear unscented deodorant stick has a distinctive smell and will look like a layer of really thick sweaty ooze on hands, faces and this is not a good look.  “Try holding a pom-pom, football, flute or flag with this slippery goo on your hands,” Heraldson wondered aloud.  “Be smart and use this and all products as directed.”  Sweating Sucks  Teen sweating pretty much sucks in general. But when you have to go back to school, after a summer of ballin', hangin' and straight-chillin’, the amount that it sucks can be compounded by excessive sweating. “While we are not able to make the transition to adult hood any smoother the makers of SwampButt Underwear can provide an undergarment that will wick, and dry excessive butt sweat,” Heraldson concluded.

The School kept It Quiet For Nearly Two Years.  Product: csmonitor.com  Message: MS-13 Murdered A California High School Student. The School Kept It Quiet For Nearly Two Years. ELMER MARTINEZ/AFP/Getty Images  By ASHE SCHOW @ASHESCHOW August 10, 2019 Brayan Andino, 16, was murdered by MS-13 gang members after he was lured to Lake Balboa in Los Angeles, California, back in October 2017. Two female gang associates, who were also students, had gained Andino’s trust, which is why he went with them to the lake. The two were part of the Fulton clique, a faction within MS-13. When Andino arrived at the lake, other members of the gang beat him to death. They then dismembered his body, cut his heart out, and threw him into a canyon, where he was later found.   Play Video School administrators said nothing after Andino disappeared in October 2017. They said nothing when his body was found two months later. They said nothing about his funeral and didn’t even offer condolences.  The Los Angeles Times reported at the end of July that Panorama High School — where Andino was a student — declined to let parents, students, and teachers know about the dangers of the gang. The school reportedly claimed that MS-13 had little presence on the campus and had never committed violence on the campus, and therefore other students weren’t in danger.  The Times, however, reported another MS-13-related incident occurred “at the edge” of the campus just one month before Andino’s murder.  “At least two MS-13 members, including two former Panorama students, are suspected of stabbing and wounding a student as he was leaving school, officials acknowledged,” the outlet reported.  In addition to the previous incident, at least five of the 10 suspects arrested in Andino’s murder were Panorama High students, the Times reported.  The arrests weren’t even announced for 17 months. Capt. William P. Hayes, commander of the Los Angeles Police Department’s Robbery-Homicide Division, told the Times that investigators were “concerned about the flight risk of suspects and the loss of critical information.” They also worried that if word got out around the school, students discussing the murder and the gang could wind up targets themselves.  “You’re trying to prevent people from saying stupid things that would put them at risk,” he told the Times.  A federal indictment unsealed last month revealed that the gang members approached the victim, yelled “MS” to announce their gang affiliated and suspected the victim was a member of a rival gang. The victim claimed he was not, but was stabbed “in the back and abdomen.” The student survived after he managed to make it to the school’s office, where someone was able to call for help.  The Times described MS-13’s presence at the high school as a “beachhead,” even though the school district has apparently denied such a presence. From the Times:  As details of the gang’s connections have become public over the last week, some parents and teachers have questioned why officials didn’t alert the campus community earlier.  Only after a federal grand jury indicted 22 adults on racketeering and murder charges earlier this month did officials with the Los Angeles Unified School District acknowledge that students from Panorama High had also been arrested.  The accused, according to Prosecutors, are members of the Fulton clique that killed seven people in the span of more than two years.  Kelly Gonez, the school board representative for the San Fernando Valley area, told the Times that the school district relies on law enforcement for judgment.  “In situations like these, we rely on the best judgment of the law enforcement experts who are working to uncover the truth and bring perpetrators to justice,” she said. “The best way to ensure the safety of our students, staff and families at Panorama High School and the broader community is to ensure that these violent criminals are arrested and put in jail.”  READ MORE: MS-13 GANG What's Your Reaction?",8/11/2019 0:00,,,Junk,,,FALSE,

It is time for action. In her landmark book, Healing the Soul of America, which was first published in 1997, she discussed why reparations made economic sense, was an act of healing systemic racism and was a debt owed to the families of former slaves.  Reparations were key to her platform when she announced for the presidency in January 2019 and led the discussion on the idea in the presidential contest.  In June, Marianne also talked about reparations on CBS’ The Takeout with Major Garrett saying, “There is an inherent mea culpa, there is an inherent acknowledgment of a wrong that has been done by one people to another and of a debt owed.”  https://www.marianne2020.com/posts/presidential-candidate-marianne-williamson-on-the-takeout Williamson says “Yes, we ended slavery. Yes, we passed Civil Rights legislation – including the Voting Rights Act – in the 1960’s. But no, we have not yet fully done all that it is morally incumbent upon us to do in order to heal this ugly wound. The forty acres and a mule promised to every former slave after the Civil War was not a joke; it was a means by which a formerly enslaved population would have had a chance to integrate economically into life as a freed citizen. While a few were, in fact, given their acreage, the vast majority were not – and most who received them would see the land given back to previous owners over time.”  “In life, there are situations where talk without action not only fails to heal a wound, but exacerbates it. Since World War II, Germany paid $89 billion in reparations to Jewish organizations and America should do the same after centuries of racial oppression, in large part stemming from our history with slavery. While nothing can undo the terror of the Holocaust or the slave trade, reparations can push a new frontier in racial reconciliation in America,” said Williamson.  Williamson has proposed a “Reparations Commission” to guide the way. Black leaders in culture, academia, and politics comprising the commission would disperse $200-500 billion over ten years to promote education, infrastructure, and projects dedicated to black communities.  “When it comes to paying reparations for slavery, on an emotional, psychological and spiritual level, we cannot afford not to,” says Williamson. “Until we do, this cycle of violence that began in the 1600s and continues to this day will continue to haunt our psyche.”  Read the entire Reparations Plan here: https://www.marianne2020.com/posts/the-reparations-plan  ###  ============================================================ ** (https://twitter.com/marwilliamson) ** (https://www.facebook.com/williamsonmarianne/) ** (https://www.instagram.com/mariannewilliamson/) ** (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXAMXGAP0YnBxtc8brSSbjg) ** (https://www.marianne2020.com) Copyright © 2019 Marianne Williamson for President, All rights reserved.

There are drugs everywhere and everyone is using it. I saw a mother smoking weed with her 2-year-old son by her side. How horrible the situation has become! The subway also stinks of drugs as if someone had been smoking without any hindrance. There is no shame. Drug addicts are free to smoke wherever they want. The police do nothing to the users. It is prohibited by law, but nothing can be done against users. They have rights to guarantee their respect. This is why drug use is spreading so rapidly in Brazil. The user is primarily responsible for funding violence and arms trafficking and is litteraly the one who give the money to maintain the drug cartel alive, so why they are not been punished or at least used as a source of information to stop traffickers? If there was education no one would go after this problem and no one would become an addict. But I don't think Brazil want to end drug trafficking. They do nothing about it! There is no education, there are no alerts, there is no action, there is nothing. They know exactly who's selling, who's the bosses, where they live, where the drugs came from, but police operations are always a joke. They make a lot of noise when they get to the slums and the bad guys always run away. There is no planning, there is no intelligence. I guess they never heard of under cover missions. They take something here, something there, but it's never enough to really damage the drug cartel. Something strange is happening in Brazil. Why are they sitting around waiting for something really bad to happen? Why are they denying an epidemic when it becomes so evident when you walk the streets there? Wherever you go, you see people using all kinds of drugs. Kids that don't go to the school so  they can go to a park and use wherever, little kids playing alongside drug users, in parks, on the streets, at bus stops, scattered everywhere!

I always hoped it was true, I am afraid to speak to him about it however I don't want to cause any more devastation to him or his family. I was thinking of giving him one of my recent journals but am reluctant, because I don't want to cause any friction in our relationship I think he might not to be bothered and will think ill of me, Any ideas would be helpful, is it possible for the C.S PUBLICATIONS to maybe mail one issue to his house without his  knowing I was involved. Perhaps I am not approaching this correctly I don't know  Sincerely John Category: General question Name: john cunningham",8/9/2019 0:00,CSPS,CSPS,Gift,,,FALSE,
5000g000028b9RWAAY,South Coast Rail Early Action Culvert and Grade Crossing Construction Update,"South Coast Rail [ https://www.mass.gov/south-coast-rail ]  You are subscribed to the South Coast Rail Project from the Massachusetts Department of Transportation.  Dear Friends of South Coast Rail,  MassDOT's contractor will perform work at theFRN-17 and FRN-20 culvert locations [ https://www.mass.gov/files/documents/2019/05/30/dot-scr_eac_culverts_May%202019.pdf ] in Freetown on the Fall River Secondary branch of the Phase 1 corridor north of Elm Street and south of Richmond Road *beginning at 6:00 AM on Thursday, August 8, and continuing 24 hours per day through midnight on Monday night, August 12*.  Primary construction access will be via rail from the northerly and southerly Richmond Road grade crossings in Freetown, the Myricks Street grade crossing in Berkley, and the laydown area near the Elm Street grade crossing in Freetown where the contractor is staging materials, equipment, and employee parking. Additional material and equipment staging will be located at the Myricks Street grade crossing in Berkley. Equipment will also use the following grade crossings throughout the construction period: Mill Street and Adams Street in Berkley, Beechwood Road and Forge Road (northerly and southerly crossings) in Freetown. All work will be performed on the railroad corridor.  This work will be disruptive to local residents. Crews will be using various pieces of heavy equipment and trucks along the railroad right-of-way throughout the construction period.  While the project will seek to minimize construction-related impacts to communities, noise will be generated and work lights will be used along the right-of-way.  MassDOT's Contractor is also continuing to perform work in New Bedford at the Tarkiln Hill Road grade crossing on the New Bedford Main Line branch of the Phase 1 corridor. During the next two weeks this work is expected to include installation of a drainage swale and removal of stockpiled soil for disposal. Work will be performed weekdays between 7:00 AM and 5:00 PM. Vehicular and pedestrian access will be maintained through all roadway work zones and access to local businesses will not be impacted.  Work on the Culvert Replacement Project and in the vicinity of the Tarkiln Hill Road Grade Crossing is anticipated to be completed by January 2020.

5000g000028bHkjAAE,Review and/or Show Guest - New Book Informs Kids About The Day: 9/11 Courage and Tributes,"Dear Stephanie Hanes :  America pledged to 'Never Forget' the events of September 11, 2001. But as the 18th anniversary of our nation's darkest day approaches, there's more to do to ensure future generations also never forget.  Author and Context Productions CEO Kristie Kiernan Bouryal's new release for children, 9/11 Courage and Tributes, was written to raise awareness to the events of that fateful day and is a tribute to the fallen and the courage of everyday heroes. It is the author's intention that the three books in her Discovering Heroes™ series, which are all based on true events, will help children to better understand that day, its aftermath and the bravery of the men and women who lost their lives and those who carried on. The author's parents (her father was a former lieutenant in the NYC Fire Department and her mother a former nurse), were the inspiration behind the series.   Please read the following press release and let me know if I may forward a copy of Kristie's new book in consideration of an interview or review from you. If you wish to do a feature story, I'd be happy to send JPEGs of the author and book cover. Thank you.  Brian Johnson Ascot Media Group, Inc. Post Office Box 2394 Friendswood, TX 77549 news@ascotmedianews.com ascotmedia.com 281.333.3507 Phone 800.854.2207 Fax  (This press release may be reprinted in part or entirety by any print or broadcast media outlet, or used by any means of social media sharing)  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  As 9/11 Anniversary Approaches, New Book Informs Kids About The Day, The Courage Of The Fallen And Everyday Heroes  **New York, NY, August 7, 2019** — Context Productions, a media company, is releasing its latest book for kids, 9/11 Courage and Tributes. The book is the third in the Discovering Heroes™ series, which increases awareness about September 11, 2001 and everyday heroes.  ""We have a whole generation of kids who are largely uninformed about 9/11, yet we are on track to lose more people to 9/11-related illnesses than we lost that day,” said CEO and Author Kristie Kiernan Bouryal.   According to the World Trade Center (WTC) Health Program as of March 31, 2019, more than 95,000 people enrolled in the program and more than 49,000 have at least one disease certified as a 9/11-related illness. Since 9/11, more than 2,350 members of the program have died—over 2,100 were first responders.   ""9/11 is a day that is still harming people – and this is going to continue for years to come. Many vowed to 'Never Forget,' but those words require action. I'm calling on every educator, parent, grandparent, close relative or friend of a child to use this book and others in the series to engage kids about 9/11,” said Bouryal.   Bouryal's books are all based on true events. Her parents, John Kiernan, a former lieutenant in the Fire Department of the City of New York (FDNY), and Benita Kiernan, a former nurse, inspired the series. They are the grandparent characters in the series who lovingly inform their grandchildren about 9/11, and the fallen and everyday heroes, by responding to the kids' many questions.    In 9/11 Courage and Tributes, the family visits special tributes created to honor and remember those we lost. The grandkids learn about the courage of everyday heroes, including their role in America's largest water evacuation, and that 9/11 is still harming people.   In the second book in the series, Remembering Heroes, the family visits FDNY's Rescue Company 1 in New York City to attend a memorial service for 9/11. There, the kids learn about the nearly 3,000 people lost that day, including the 343 members of the FDNY and the 11 fallen heroes from that firehouse, all while they explore the meaning of everyday heroes and see them in action. In the first book of the series, My Buddy's a Hero – And I Didn't Even Know It, the grandkids learn for the first time that their grandfather was part of the rescue and recovery efforts and helped rescue the last man out alive from the ruins of the World Trade Center.   This series of books is fitting for kids of all ages, especially seven through eleven.

5000g000028bhHHAAY,Editorial comments and corrections,"The following information was collected:  Name: John  Email: robledoint@yahoo.com  Subscriber: No  Subject: War Criminals Among Us: Bush,cheney, and the eyes of the world  Product: csmonitor.com  Message: War Criminals Among Us: Bush, Cheney, and the Eyes of the World In which we learn how to say 'war crimes' in Malaysian. image BY CHARLES P. PIERCE JUN 1, 2015 imageGETTY IMAGES Last week, Richard Clarke, the man to whom nobody in the administration of C-Plus Augustus listened because what did he know, anyway?, had a chat with Amy Goodman in which he minced no words regarding his former employers.  ""I think things that they authorized probably fall within the area of war crimes. Whether that would be productive or not, I think, is a discussion we could all have. But we have established procedures now with the International Criminal Court in The Hague, where people who take actions as serving presidents or prime ministers of countries have been indicted and have been tried. So the precedent is there to do that sort of thing. And I think we need to ask ourselves whether or not it would be useful to do that in the case of members of the Bush administration. It's clear that things that the Bush administration did — in my mind, at least, it's clear that some of the things they did were war crimes.""  And, something that most of us missed, there was a court on the other side of the world that agreed.  In what is the first ever conviction of its kind anywhere in the world, the former US President and seven key members of his administration were... found guilty of war crimes. Bush, Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld and their legal advisers Alberto Gonzales, David Addington, William Haynes, Jay Bybee and John Yoo were tried in absentia in Malaysia...At the end of the week-long hearing, the five-panel tribunal unanimously delivered guilty verdicts against Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld and their key legal advisors who were all convicted as war criminals for torture and cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment. Full transcripts of the charges, witness statements and other relevant material will now be sent to the Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, as well as the United Nations and the Security Council.  At the very least, this court parceled out the blame for the torture program in a fair manner and all the way up the chain of command. The testimony of the victims was as horrible as you might expect:  The court heard how Abbas Abid, a 48-year-old engineer from Fallujah in Iraq had his fingernails removed by pliers; Ali Shalal was attached with bare electrical wires and electrocuted and hung from a wall; Moazzam Begg was beaten, hooded and put in solitary confinement, Jameelah was stripped and humiliated, and was used as a human shield whilst being transported by helicopter. The witnesses also detailed how they have residual injuries till today.  In related news, Ed Kilgore notes that Cheney continues to glory in his status as the most inexcusable American who ever lived. It's like giving Pol Pot a late-night TV gig.  At times, Mr. Cheney seems to relish his villainous public persona. Outside the rodeo arena, he took a moment to show off the latest feature on his truck, a Darth Vader trailer-hitch cover, a nod to his alter-ego from the Bush days. ""I'm rather proud of that,"" he said, flashing his signature uneven grin.  To paraphrase Rick Blaine, I don't object to a vampire, I object to a gutless one. I'll buy the stake if someone else buys the garlic.  CHARLES P.

Data for a digital brain Thousands of studies have probed the behavior of Kv channels, in various cells, by measuring the movement of ions across tiny patches of cell membrane at controlled voltages. In the early years of the Blue Brain Project, neuroscientist Dr. Rajnish Ranjan was tasked with modelling the behavior of Kv channels, based on these studies, for use in its  <http://tracking.vuelio.co.uk/tracking/click?d=1vmwq0NxNLm-G_BFktwTAdcUd9Mj0QH_VgJYMRxEgYw123K7xlxw9mIIzv_dGhwHJS7AxpcoAnqqjz06j3SA_qNKsQ8lyj2vX-cxRaTF45AnoAytLNAceOFfuv-SuB4ucqYW0EierEUgodxWDV1_ymc1> brain simulations. “To my surprise, even after 30 years of research, none of the raw data was available,” recalls Ranjan, lead author of the new study. Even the published, processed data reflected a Wild West of study protocols, with inconsistent and incompatible results. Many Kv channels were hardly or never studied, and crucially, across the board there was a lack of studies near body temperature. “Near body temperature, fatty cell membranes soften and slip away from recording apparatus. So, virtually all studies were performed at room temperature,” Ranjan explains. No data – no accurate Kv channel models – no brain simulation. If the Blue Brain team were to succeed, they would need to record their own Kv channel data – thirty years’ worth of it. Bringing ion channel research in from the cold Fortunately, the Blue Brain team includes an ion channel-recording robot. By automating recordings, this allowed them to overcome the high failure rate near body temperature with sheer speed and volume of attempts. The result is the first ever map of the behavior of all Kv channels – or any family of ion channels, for that matter. The map by turns reconciles, reinforces and refutes the last thirty years of Kv channel studies. “Under standardized conditions and with large sample sizes, the behavior of Kv channels is largely consistent across cell lines and species. And as expected, quantitatively, Kv channels activate and inactivate faster at 35°C than at 25°C or 15°C. “The big new finding was that Kv channels behave qualitatively very differently from 15°C, to 25°C to 35°C.” For instance, some channels inactivate only at higher temperature, so were previously wrongly taken as non-inactivating despite thousands of studies at room temperature. Others display a new type of delayed inactivation. Even more surprising, some channels change their behavior seemingly at random – which though unexplained, could underlie some of the inconsistencies between previous studies. “The qualitative differences we found at 35°C clearly demand further tests,” says Ranjan. In particular, the team’s method should be applied to systematically study Kv channel behavior in the presence of known modulators – like protein signals, chaperones and anchors – or genetic channel variants. Beyond this, work is already underway at Blue Brain to map the behavior of other voltage-gated ion channels, including ones that allow Na+, or any positive ion to cross the cell membrane. Ultimately, they will require all of these to build a digital copy of the brain. Channelpedia The importance of these findings is more immediate than Blue Brain’s ambitious whole-brain simulations, however. The study data will enable researchers everywhere to develop their own improved models for Kv channels – useful, for example, in drug discovery. “The data and methods we have established to map the behavior of Kv channels can be used to systematically screen drug candidates for potentially positive or deleterious effects on channel behavior,” suggests Ranjan. To this end, the study team has provided open access to their million-plus Kv channel recordings from over 9,000 cells, and a growing dataset for other channels. These are publicly available for download in a dedicated, wiki-like platform called  <http://tracking.vuelio.co.uk/tracking/click?d=_KH8UrsbzXgA2Z1nq0KYs-yFhFEN9NjV2ZskkgC-eNqlr_60gfoxtHBSm3tWBwpox4MwSXVvHbJLqyI1ecjdg8vflVQDt6Gh4UBzvUhdSp14zvX-4vMXdBdDrFJRtTjiNw2> Channelpedia. “Anyone can access Channelpedia online and contribute,” Ranjan emphasizes. “We encourage other labs to share their ion channel data to expand and refine this resource.” The models the team provides, based on its systematic data collections, make it possible to interpret any channel recording in the context of physiological temperature. “The temperature-activity relationships established in our models allow recordings at any temperature to be converted to physiological temperature,” explains Ranjan. “This is a really key contribution of our work, since channel recordings at physiological temperature remain difficult and future experiments will likely continue to be performed at lower temperatures.”             ###              Please link to the original research article in your reporting:   <http://tracking.vuelio.co.uk/tracking/click?d=2FhhNW_q0aji_UX4hjOetVXAGcRvB2E_mV_8IIQTc_NEyzdfrgEZ4pOEtXfwzSmbThu3bpWh_-UTiF8ZD7meXKnsDCEX5gRYIalM44TAAPVcaWTJWZ4LdjuYpzuA9WItJIbdT5UCQFQIv9_T9F-ZT2Co99igTt9UJhBCMu51g6C20> https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00358/full Corresponding author: Dr. Rajnish Ranjan,  <mailto:ranjan.rajnish@epfl.ch> ranjan.rajnish@epfl.ch About Channelpedia Channelpedia is a knowledge-based framework centered on genetically expressed ion channel experimental data, models, and it encourages researchers of the field to contribute, build and refine the information through an interactive wiki-like interface.

COMMUNIQUE SANCTIONNANT LE CONSEIL DES MINISTRES.  Image   Le nouveau siège de l’ARCEP inauguré ce mercredi à Lomé par le Premier ministre  Lomé, le 07 Août 2019-  Le Premier ministre Komi Selom KLASOU a inauguré ce mercredi 7 août 2019 à Lomé, les nouveaux bâtiments devant abriter l’Autorité de Régulation des Communications Electroniques et des Postes (ARCEP ex-ARTP).   La cérémonie s’est déroulée en présence d’un parterre de personnalités, composé des membres du gouvernement, des représentants des chancelleries ainsi que des organisations internationales. La construction de cet ouvrage, s’inscrit dans la politique du gouvernement qui vise à doter les administrations publiques, de cadres de travail moderne et plus propice à leurs activités.  Le bâtiment, de style contemporain est situé dans le nouveau pôle administratif de Lomé. D’une superficie totale de 6.200 m2 avec une emprise au sol de 1.100 m2, cet édifice de R-l à R+5, soit 7 niveaux comprennent des bureaux, une salle de conférence, plusieurs salles de réunions, une salle du Comité de direction ainsi que des locaux techniques. Il a coûté 2,2 milliards de FCFA à l’Etat.  Abayeh Boyodi, Directeur Général de l’Autorité de Réglementation des Secteurs de Postes et de Télécommunications (ART & P), après énumération des services qu’abrite l’immeuble inauguré, a rappelé au cours de la cérémonie, les missions essentielles de l’ARCEP : Gérer et contrôler les opérateurs autorisés par le gouvernement pour établir et exploiter des réseaux et services ouverts au public; Délivrer des autorisations pour les réseaux indépendants et les agréments d’équipements; Gérer les ressources, notamment les fréquences, les ressources en numérotation et le Domaine Internet national « .tg » ;Assurer la mission d’Autorité déléguée pour la certification électronique afin d’accréditer les auditeurs de conformité et de qualifier les prestataires de services de certification électronique.  L’ARCEP qui a vu ses compétences renforcées par la loi sur les transactions électroniques (LTE) représentera l’Etat dans les organisations internationales sur des questions liées aux secteurs des communications Electroniques et des Postes. La protection des droits des consommateurs fait aussi partie de ses prérogatives.  « Cet immeuble caractérise les ambitions qu’affiche le Togo à l’ère où le numérique enregistre des mutations de plus en plus profondes », a déclaré Cina Lawson, la Ministre des Postes et de l’Economie numérique. Elle a par ailleurs témoigné sa reconnaissance au chef de l’Etat pour son leadership, faisant des TIC un véritable levier de modernisation de l’économie et de développement de la société.  Image  Les députés apportent des modifications à la loi sur les manifestations publiques au Togo  Lomé, le 07 Août 2019-  L’Assemblée nationale a adopté ce mercredi 7 août 2019, le projet de modification de la loi du 16 mai 2011 fixant les conditions d’exercice de la liberté de réunion et de manifestations pacifiques publiques en République Togolaise.  C’était à l’occasion de la première séance plénière de la quatrième session extraordinaire de l’année 2019.  Les nouvelles dispositions portent sur une dizaine d’articles en plus de la création de deux nouveaux articles relatifs aux axes et aux zones exclues des manifestations. Les présentes modifications permettent de clarifier certaines dispositions de la loi du 16 mai 2011 interprétées de façon équivoque dans leur application par les différents acteurs. Aussi permettent-elles une meilleure coordination des décisions administratives dans le cadre de la lutte contre le terrorisme.  A la lecture de la nouvelle loi adoptée, il ressort qu’il n’y aura plus de manifestations simultanées sur toutes les routes nationales, ainsi que sur les axes ou zones abritant les institutions de la République, diplomatiques, les résidences des ambassadeurs et d’organisations internationales, les camps militaires et les services de sécurité.  Les heures de manifestation vont de 11 à 18 heures dans une journée. Les manifestations se feront désormais à partir d’un point de départ, sur un seul trajet et chuter en un seul point.  « Cette révision n’est pas contre les manifestations mais pour mieux les encadrer et assurer une sécurité à ceux qui ne prennent pas part aux manifestations », affirme le Ministre de l’administration territoriale, Payadowa Boukpessi pour qui, la nouvelle modification permet aussi de mieux prévenir le Togo des problèmes sécuritaires qui secouent actuellement plusieurs pays de la sous-région Ouest africaine.  A noter qu’au cours de cette même journée, les députés ont également procédé à l’adoption du projet de loi relatif à la sécurité intérieure. Le présent projet de loi, adopté à l’unanimité comporte cinquante-six (56) articles répartis en quatre (4) titres.  Il comble le vide juridique en matière de police de proximité et renforce les règles en matière de maintien de l'ordre public et de lutte contre le terrorisme notamment les règles d'intervention, de contrôle et d'interpellation en cas de risques de trouble ou d'atteinte grave à l'ordre public.  Image   Le Plan stratégique de l’Agence nationale de la protection civile en cours de validation    Lomé, le 07 Août 2019-   L’atelier de validation du Plan stratégique de L’Agence nationale de la protection civile (ANPC) a démarré ce mercredi 7 août 2019 à Lomé.  Cette rencontre de deux jours permettra aux experts venus des différentes administrations d’analyser le document, ensuite de formuler des suggestions et des recommandations pour son amélioration. Après ces différentes étapes, ils passeront à l’adoption proprement dite du document.  A noter que le document du plan stratégique de l’ANPC, est un outil de travail qui répond aux besoins de tous les acteurs de la prévention et de gestion des catastrophes. Ce plan vise la réduction des risques liés aux catastrophes et s’inscrit dans l’axe stratégique trois du Plan National de Développement du Togo.  A l’ouverture des travaux, le directeur général de l’ANPC, le Lieutenant-colonel Baka Yoma, a salué les efforts du gouvernement qui a fait de la protection civile une des priorités du pays. Selon lui, plusieurs actions ont été menées dans ce cadre ce qui a permis de réduire considérablement la vulnérabilité des communautés et d’améliorer leur résilience.  Créée en janvier 2017 par décret présidentiel, l’ANPC a pour mission de coordonner les actions de toutes les structures intervenant dans la gestion et la prévention des catastrophes au Togo, afin de limiter les effets négatifs et de renforcer la résilience des populations.  Image   Le Togo invité à ratifier la charte de l’Union africaine sur la décentralisation     Lomé, le 07 Août 2019-   L’Union Africaine a adopté en 2014 à Malabo (Guinée Equatoriale), une charte sur la décentralisation, la gouvernance locale et le développement local.  Le document a été rédigé par un comité technique spécialisé mis en place par les chefs d’Etat et de gouvernement de l’organisation continentale.  Une délégation des membres de ce comité était en visite au Togo le mardi 6 août 2019. Conduite par le Ministre burundais de la décentralisation, Jean-Bosco Hitimana, la délégation a eu à échanger dans un premier temps avec la présidente de l’Assemblée nationale, Yawa Tségan ensuite avec le Premier ministre Komi Sélom Klassou.  La délégation a indiqué que sa mission était de faire un plaidoyer auprès des autorités togolaises pour la ratification de la charte en question. « Comme vous le savez c’est une charte qui est vraiment indispensables parce qu’elle est basée sur les valeurs et sur les principes qui fondent la dynamique africaine de solidarité, de participation, de communauté et d’inclusivité », a déclaré Calixte Mbari, membre du comité.  Cette Charte poursuit-il est un mécanisme et un dispositif qui permet de renforcer les pouvoirs de la population. « Il était donc important que nous puisons en parler avec les autorités du Togo », a-t-il ajouté.  La délégation a saisi également l'occasion pour féliciter le gouvernement pour l'organisation le 30 juin 2019 des élections locales. « Nous avons eu écho de l'organisation des élections au niveau municipal ici, c'est déjà une ébauche de mise en œuvre de la charte et nous pensons que le Togo ne va pas tarder à ratifier le texte », a laissé entendre le chef de délégation, Jean-Bosco Hitimana, à l’issue de l’entretien avec le Premier ministre.  Notons que la charte vise à promouvoir la décentralisation, la gouvernance locale et le développement local en Afrique. A soutenir la gouvernance locale et la démocratie locale comme piliers de la décentralisation. Enfin à mobiliser des ressources pour assurer le développement économique local et éradiquer la pauvreté.  Image   COMMUNIQUE SANCTIONNANT LE CONSEIL DES MINISTRES      Lomé, le 07 Août 2019-   Le Conseil des ministres s’est réuni ce Mercredi 7 août 2019 au Palais de la Présidence de la République, sous la présidence de Son Excellence, Monsieur Faure Essozimna GNASSINGBE, Président de la République.  Au cours des travaux, le conseil a :  - adopté un (1) projet de loi ;  - adopté un (1) décret ;  - écouté deux (2) communications ;  - et abordé des divers.  Au titre des projets de loi  Le projet de loi adopté par le conseil des ministres porte sur l’utilisation sûre, sécurisée et pacifique du nucléaire.   Les applications des rayonnements ionisants procurent d’importants avantages dans de nombreux domaines, notamment la santé (dépistage et traitement des cancers, sécurité sanitaire des aliments), l’agriculture et l’élevage (accroissement de la productivité des terres, multiplication des variétés de terres fertiles, amélioration de la croissance, de la reproduction et de la résistance aux maladies du bétail), l’industrie (civile et militaire), et la recherche scientifique (physique nucléaire, chimie nucléaire).  Cependant, le nucléaire et les rayonnements ionisants qu’il véhicule, comportent des effets potentiellement nocifs, pouvant résulter d’une utilisation inappropriée, d’accidents ou d’actes malveillants, dont il est impératif de protéger les personnes, la société et l’environnement. Aussi devient-il impérieux pour le Togo qui a adhéré à l’Agence Internationale de l’Energie Atomique (AIEA) le 30 novembre 2012 de se conformer aux recommandations de l’ Agence en se dotant d’un cadre juridique bien structuré qui lui permette de satisfaire les standards internationaux en matière de législation et de réglementation de l’utilisation sécurisée et sûre du nucléaire dans un but pacifique.  Au titre des décrets   Le décret adopté par le conseil précise les aspects comptables et fiscaux des opérations de crédit-bail.  L’analyse de l’environnement économique et financier de l’UMOA montre que le marché du crédit en général et celui du crédit-bail en particulier est peu développé. Cette situation résulte de la conjonction de plusieurs facteurs dont l’absence d’un cadre juridique, comptable et fiscal adéquat qui régit cette activité financière.  Pour pallier cette insuffisance, le Conseil des Ministres de l’Union, lors de sa session tenue le 14 juin 2016, a adopté la loi uniforme relative au crédit-bail ; laquelle loi le Togo a introduite dans son ordonnancement juridique interne par la loi uniforme n°2019-004 du 17 juin 2019. Le présent décret, pris en application de l’article 56 de cette loi, règle les aspects comptables et fiscaux des opérations de crédit-bail.  Au titre des communications  La première communication écoutée par le conseil des ministres est présentée par le ministre des droits de l’homme et des relations avec les institutions de la république. Elle est un compte rendu de la présentation du troisième rapport périodique sur la mise en œuvre de la convention contre la torture et autres peines ou traitements cruels et inhumains ou dégradants devant le Comité contre la torture lors de sa 67eme session à Genève (Suisse), les 26 et 29 juillet 2019.  Le rapport couvre la période 2012-2017 ; il a relevé les efforts que le Gouvernement a entrepris en matière de protection et de promotion des droits de l’homme depuis la présentation du deuxième rapport en 2012 et marqué sa volonté de poursuivre ces efforts pour le renforcement des droits de l’homme.  Le gouvernement a également saisi l’occasion de désapprouver certaines manœuvres tendant à discréditer l’action et les réformes conduites par le Gouvernement et d’apporter des preuves pour contester l’inexactitude de certaines allégations formulées.  La deuxième communication écoutée par le conseil est relative au Mécanisme de réponse immédiate aux crises et urgences au Togo (MRI).  Elle est présentée par Madame la ministre de la planification du développement et de la coopération.  Pour la gestion des urgences relatives aux crises et catastrophes naturelles par les pays, le Groupe de la Banque Mondiale a mis en place un instrument flexible d’accès rapide à des ressources dénommé Mécanisme de réponse immédiate (MRI).  Le MRI est un appui aux pays éligibles à l’Association internationale de développement (IDA), parallèlement aux financements des projets en cours de mise en œuvre pour faire face aux crises qui surviendront. Ce mécanisme permet de bénéficier des ressources à hauteur de 5% du solde non décaissé des projets de contingence contenus dans le portefeuille de la Banque mondiale en cours pour planifier la riposte aux crises et atténuer les risques de catastrophe survenus.  Une mission de la Banque mondiale a séjourné à Lomé du 29 avril au 10 mai 2019 pour lancer la conception du manuel d’opérationnalisation et former les utilisateurs à travers des ateliers. Le gouvernement précisera l’organe de coordination qui aura pour missions, entre autres, de donner les orientations générales nécessaires pour la bonne exécution du mécanisme. La troisième communication écoutée par le conseil porte sur la tenue du premier forum économique Togo Union Européenne organisé à Lomé les 13 et 14 juin 2019 et placé sous le thème central « bâtir des relations économiques durables et pérennes entre le Togo et l’union européenne ».  Le ministre du commerce, de l’industrie, du développement du secteur privé et de la promotion de la consommation locale a fait connaître que tous les différents acteurs, notamment les autorités européennes, le secteur privé, les conférenciers, les participants, ont apprécié la réussite de ce forum qui a atteint et dépassé les objectifs fixés.  En effet, le forum a réussi une forte mobilisation de ressources humaines :  - 1216 participants au lieu de 400 attendus, soit 408 participants étrangers venant de 54 pays, 752 participants locaux et 56 Togolais de la Diaspora ;  - 94 conférenciers et modérateurs de renommée nationale et internationale contre 70 attendus.  Il en est également ainsi des projets dont 140 ont été retenus pour près de 1 769 807 318 euros soit1160 993 600 458 de FCFA.  Il est indéniable que ce succès obtenu, n’a pu l’être que grâce au leadership visionnaire du Président de la République qui s’est personnellement investi pour la présence effective de personnalités remarquables à ce forum et a tenu à marquer de sa présence les travaux, démontrant une fois de plus son engagement à faire mobiliser les moyens nécessaires pour la réussite du PND.  Le Gouvernement a renouvelé son admiration pour le Président de la République pour son impulsion et son implication personnelle dans la réussite du forum.  Le gouvernement exprime sa reconnaissance à la délégation de l’Union Européenne et à l’ensemble du secteur privé togolais pour les efforts de tous ordres consentis pour l’organisation et le bon déroulement des activités programmées.  Au titre des divers  Le Premier ministre a transmis les félicitations du Président de la République aux membres du Gouvernement pour le travail abattu pendant ces six mois d’exercice de fonctions et les a exhortés à cultiver la performance, le travail en synergie et la collégialité dans la recherche des réponses aux besoins des populations.  Madame la ministre du développement à la base, de l’artisanat et de la jeunesse a rendu compte au conseil des ministres de la visite, dans notre pays, du Gouverneur de l’Etat du Mississipi, Monsieur Phil BRYANT du 11 au 14 août 2019, dans le cadre d’une tournée africaine.  Le Premier ministre a demandé aux ministres de prendre les dispositions nécessaires pour préparer et accueillir cette visite qui constitue une occasion de renforcer les liens de coopération avec les Etats Unis dans les domaines surtout de la transformation et la professionnalisation de l’agriculture ainsi que dans d’autres secteurs.

5000g000028bNn4AAE,Editorial comments and corrections,"The following information was collected:  Name: John  Email: robledoint@yahoo.com  Subscriber: No  Subject: Confirmed: Dayton Shooter Was Antifa Terrorist  And That is Not All.......  Product: csmonitor.com  Message: Confirmed: Dayton Shooter Was Antifa Terrorist, And That’s Not All…  (Tea Party PAC) – It has been confirmed that Connor Betts, the man who opened fire on a crowd outside a Dayton, Ohio bar over the weekend, killing nine people, was in fact a member of Antifa.  Not only that, but he attended an Antifa rally earlier this year, armed with a rifle.  The same rifle he used to gun down nine innocent and seemingly random people on Sunday morning.  This is all according to a local Ohio news source, WHIO, who reports that he attended a protest against the Ku Klux Klan while armed with the same rifle he used over the weekend to commit his heinous act.  They report that he briefly spoke to a reporter from their outlet while wearning a bandana and sunglasses to cover his face.  Betts was likely made aware of this rally by the far-left Antifa doxxing account, Antifash Gordon, as a screenshot provided by journalist Nick Monroe displays:    This is just the latest in what is turning out to be a mound of evidence that the shooter was a far-left extremist.  This is so well-established, that even CNN has been forced to report as much.  They reported earlier this week:  A Twitter account that appears to belong to Dayton mass shooter Connor Bettsretweeted extreme left-wing and anti-police posts, as well as tweets supporting Antifa, or anti-fascist, protesters.  The most recent tweet on the @iamthespookster account was on August 3, the day of the shooting, when he retweeted a post saying, “Millenials have a message for the Joe Biden generation: hurry up and die.” He also retweeted messages supporting Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.  The user’s Twitter bio reads: “he/him / anime fan / metalhead / leftist / I’m going to hell and I’m not coming back.” One tweet used the hashtag #HailSatan.  The account also retweeted posts against ICE agents, including one that said, “these people are monsters,” and multiple posts condemning police, and supporting Antifa protesters, who often use violent tactics. There were also many tweets of selfies, photos with a friend and ordinary memes and nonpolitical content.",8/8/2019 0:00,CSM,CSM.com,Junk,,,FALSE,
5000g000028bMF1AAM,Re : csmonitor.com : Google Indexing Issues.,"Hi csmonitor.com,   I noticed something interesting while going through your website,   csmonitor.com .   It's apparent that you have used Adwords marketing to promote your business   in the past; however your website does see some organic search traffic here   and there. Now, I believe I can help increase that portion of organic   traffic significantly, at csmonitor.com.   I believe you would like to come top on searches for keywords related to:   csmonitor.com .. I found a number of SEO issues such as broken links, page   speed issue, HTML validation errors, and images with no ALT text on your   website, that's stopping you from getting that traffic.   How about I fix those, and also promote you through engaging content on   relevant places on the web (read, social media).  I guarantee you will see a drastic change in your search ranking and   traffic once these issues are fixed. Also, this is one time, so no paying   Adwords every month.   Is this something you are interested in? We have a very special offer for   the month of August 2019.   I also prepared a “Free Website Audit Report” for your website. If you are   interested i can show you the report.   I'd be happy to send you our package, pricing and past work details, if   you'd like to assess our work.   I look forward to hearing from you.    Best Regards,    Patrice Barnes | Digital Marketing Specialist  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Note: Kindly please email with the subject line ""Interested"" or allow me to   sent ""No Obligation Audit Report"".   --  To unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to customerservice+unsubscribe@csps.com.",8/8/2019 0:00,,,Junk,,,FALSE,

This is Deborah. I wanted to touch base with you after a tumultuous few days.  Bill's appearance on the Ingraham Angle on Monday night had to be postponed for personal reasons. Fortunately, they were able to reschedule him for tonight (Tuesday). So don't forget to tune into Fox News tonight at 10pm (EDT). He'll be talking about his CNN interview (among other things). It's very exciting!  After the horrifying events in El Paso and Dayton, I've been troubled by some of the things I've seen on social media, from ""talking heads,"" and even from some Democratic candidates  Like so many of you, I'm saddened by the loss of innocent life. I wish I had the answers that would put an end to such violence - how to stop the hate, how to heal the troubled minds behind these acts.  What I don't like is the blame game. We didn't blame President Obama for the massacre at Sandy Hook or President Clinton for the Columbine killings. We should not be using these tragedies to point fingers or advance a political agenda. Sometimes I wonder if there are groups who have press releases already filled out, just waiting to fill in the names of the next tragedy so they can score their political points.  What we should be doing is mourning and uniting in a time of sorrow. We should be doing some soul searching. We should be listening to each other, not shouting at one another.  We have so many freedoms in America, but sometimes we take advantage of the wrong ones. We speak, but we don't hear. We value press over respect for others and even the truth. We confuse the difference between freedom of religion and try to make it freedom ""from"" religion.  I am so tired of seeing people leap to turn tragedy into a political weapon. I can't speak for others, but personally, I'll be tuning out the noise from the media and politicians and looking for ways I can spread unity in my own community.  For faith, family and freedom, Dr. Deborah Owens  P.S. Your prayers and financial support will help us put this country on the right path. Please help us as we strengthen our grassroots network and work to educate and inspire pastors, community leaders, and politicians to defend our Christian rights. Donate to CAAP today!

5000g000028bXc6AAE,"Testing, testing....for pregnancy","Stephanie?,  Whether you’re testing for a hopeful positive or a hopeful negative, pregnancy testing can be a very stressful and uncertain activity for many women.  Is a negative test before a missed period accurate?  How long should she wait before taking her next test?  Between false positives and varying test results, it’s common for women to excessively test until they feel they’ve gotten the most precise reading .  Before buying out the entire pregnancy test aisle, Dr. Mary Jane Minkin, Clinical Professor of OB/GYN at Yale University is available to offer women her guide to pregnancy testing- including a test timeline to ensure they are getting the most accurate results.  Let me know if you'd like to chat with Dr. Minkin.

5000g000028bbD1AAI,Neither: Anti- or Pro...,"Being neither Pro nor Anti-  firing arms, shouldn’t congress be discussing a constitutional amendment update, clarifying the 2nd amendment? It is nebulous and confusing, written in an era of single-shot unrifled long-guns, long  before revolvers & automatic pistols existed. Most deaths in the US are pistol suisides. The original idea behind the 2nd amendment was for individuals to be able to defend their home, to include warding off an out of control central government. There was no intention for innocent people to be killed indiscriminately by the mentally unstable, whereby today abusers utilize drugs.   Since we do not want Congress to take away our rights, nor want more innocent people endangered, our forefathers gave us a way to solve the problem. Have a serious discussion today, by way of a constitutional amendment. If we cannot agree on interpretation, leave it the way it is.  While the Press expresses sensationalized events, we continue to wish for Congress to not take away our rights, yet  maintain harmlessness to innocent people, not be endangered. Our forefathers gave us a way to solve the problem during that period of time. Agree now on a modern interpretation where domestically we have the right to bear arms for protection, with restrictions in mindful constraint, allowing only authorities to Carry concealed and publicly, and to freely explore and exploit potential violators, leaving law the way it has been written.  -The people have spoken.  --  To unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to dailylift+unsubscribe@csps.com.",8/9/2019 0:00,,,Junk,,,FALSE,

Data for a digital brain Thousands of studies have probed the behavior of Kv channels, in various cells, by measuring the movement of ions across tiny patches of cell membrane at controlled voltages. In the early years of the Blue Brain Project, neuroscientist Dr. Rajnish Ranjan was tasked with modelling the behavior of Kv channels, based on these studies, for use in its  <http://tracking.vuelio.co.uk/tracking/click?d=1vmwq0NxNLm-G_BFktwTAdcUd9Mj0QH_VgJYMRxEgYw123K7xlxw9mIIzv_dGhwHJS7AxpcoAnqqjz06j3SA_hopq15JO67VM3vawe--u47BPnf77N8JHzZ2dGH-O0iPs-6I1kPn7bsQMrwuii8shhw1> brain simulations. “To my surprise, even after 30 years of research, none of the raw data was available,” recalls Ranjan, lead author of the new study. Even the published, processed data reflected a Wild West of study protocols, with inconsistent and incompatible results. Many Kv channels were hardly or never studied, and crucially, across the board there was a lack of studies near body temperature. “Near body temperature, fatty cell membranes soften and slip away from recording apparatus. So, virtually all studies were performed at room temperature,” Ranjan explains. No data – no accurate Kv channel models – no brain simulation. If the Blue Brain team were to succeed, they would need to record their own Kv channel data – thirty years’ worth of it. Bringing ion channel research in from the cold Fortunately, the Blue Brain team includes an ion channel-recording robot. By automating recordings, this allowed them to overcome the high failure rate near body temperature with sheer speed and volume of attempts. The result is the first ever map of the behavior of all Kv channels – or any family of ion channels, for that matter. The map by turns reconciles, reinforces and refutes the last thirty years of Kv channel studies. “Under standardized conditions and with large sample sizes, the behavior of Kv channels is largely consistent across cell lines and species. And as expected, quantitatively, Kv channels activate and inactivate faster at 35°C than at 25°C or 15°C. “The big new finding was that Kv channels behave qualitatively very differently from 15°C, to 25°C to 35°C.” For instance, some channels inactivate only at higher temperature, so were previously wrongly taken as non-inactivating despite thousands of studies at room temperature. Others display a new type of delayed inactivation. Even more surprising, some channels change their behavior seemingly at random – which though unexplained, could underlie some of the inconsistencies between previous studies. “The qualitative differences we found at 35°C clearly demand further tests,” says Ranjan. In particular, the team’s method should be applied to systematically study Kv channel behavior in the presence of known modulators – like protein signals, chaperones and anchors – or genetic channel variants. Beyond this, work is already underway at Blue Brain to map the behavior of other voltage-gated ion channels, including ones that allow Na+, or any positive ion to cross the cell membrane. Ultimately, they will require all of these to build a digital copy of the brain. Channelpedia The importance of these findings is more immediate than Blue Brain’s ambitious whole-brain simulations, however. The study data will enable researchers everywhere to develop their own improved models for Kv channels – useful, for example, in drug discovery. “The data and methods we have established to map the behavior of Kv channels can be used to systematically screen drug candidates for potentially positive or deleterious effects on channel behavior,” suggests Ranjan. To this end, the study team has provided open access to their million-plus Kv channel recordings from over 9,000 cells, and a growing dataset for other channels. These are publicly available for download in a dedicated, wiki-like platform called  <http://tracking.vuelio.co.uk/tracking/click?d=_KH8UrsbzXgA2Z1nq0KYs-yFhFEN9NjV2ZskkgC-eNqIr2JyWLr6AcC10K7QimeX8w0Dw8eLvix-FqCpkhu4G_L2dCUFyorznTCLejkXE7q8IBg1Q9vJlObrxiYj_bxVWQ2> Channelpedia. “Anyone can access Channelpedia online and contribute,” Ranjan emphasizes. “We encourage other labs to share their ion channel data to expand and refine this resource.” The models the team provides, based on its systematic data collections, make it possible to interpret any channel recording in the context of physiological temperature. “The temperature-activity relationships established in our models allow recordings at any temperature to be converted to physiological temperature,” explains Ranjan. “This is a really key contribution of our work, since channel recordings at physiological temperature remain difficult and future experiments will likely continue to be performed at lower temperatures.”             ###              Please link to the original research article in your reporting:   <http://tracking.vuelio.co.uk/tracking/click?d=2FhhNW_q0aji_UX4hjOetVXAGcRvB2E_mV_8IIQTc_NEyzdfrgEZ4pOEtXfwzSmbThu3bpWh_-UTiF8ZD7meXKnsDCEX5gRYIalM44TAAPUnZbz7OsekTxDFe-qlQW2pX4IwV3e2ziMdRHlfooWpFNr0B6bhZ-ni4fU2UrFyr23x0> https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00358/full Corresponding author: Dr. Rajnish Ranjan,  <mailto:ranjan.rajnish@epfl.ch> ranjan.rajnish@epfl.ch About Channelpedia Channelpedia is a knowledge-based framework centered on genetically expressed ion channel experimental data, models, and it encourages researchers of the field to contribute, build and refine the information through an interactive wiki-like interface.

5000g000028bd6UAAQ,Security & Parking Complaint,"Hello  I would like to file a complaint regarding a parking and security for the Christian Science Plaza.  iI purchased the spot via SpotHero and was put in an unsafe position because of gross lack of communication between your organization, the Pilgrim Parking Company,  and the Spothero. Spothero Rental ID 24648163  At around 12:20 am on 8/10 I returned to the plaza to get my car. I approached a clearly indicated pedestrian entrance to find a locked gate. I then walked around the building to approach two other entrances which were both locked. One entrance had a call box which I attempted to use with no response. I proceeded to walk around the building again to seek out other entrances or security and found no options. I returned to the call box to try to contact staff. Eventually, the door by the call box unlocked. All that indicated this was a small ""click"" for the door and a small light flashed on a badge access box. There was no verbal communication from staff as a return to my multiple attempts of contact. I managed to return to my car and exited the facility.  As a whole, this was an incredibly unsafe and distressing experience that needs to be addressed by the parking company, site, and Spothero. I cannot be promised a safe and accessible parking facility to be met with locked doors no staff response. As this happened at night I was terrified of not having access to my means of transportation standing stranded outside of a locked building.  SpotHero Complaints: SpotHero indicated that my ticket purchase was for a 24/7 accessible site, with listed amenities including staff on site. The instructions for using the facility gave no explanation for entering or exiting the facilities, which would lead me to trust that I can easily enter without major concerns.  When I got home I checked the Christian Science website which states, ""Currently during construction, parking in the Christian Science Plaza garage is restricted to Church Service attendees and those holding monthly passes. Paid public parking garages are also available in the Prudential Center and on Westland Avenue (near Symphony Hall), and there is limited street parking in the area.Free 3-hour bus parking is available on Huntington Avenue, Westbound, adjacent to the Christian Science Plaza. Drop off at Library entrance.""  None of this information is listed on the Pilgrim Parking website or on SpotHero. This is unacceptable.  Facility complaints are as follows: Poor signage that indicated pedestrian entrance but no information for open/closures. Web information insufficiently distributed to related organizations. Poor staff response onsite to locked doors and call boxes. Severe communication issues with SpotHero that incorrectly list the parking accessibility.  I am contacting the SpotHero and parking company directly to file my complaint as well.  Please email or call to discuss your options in remedying this situation.

Couldn't open her mouth. Couldn't even blink her eyes to signal to those standing over her. She could hear the sirens. See the flashing lights. But she felt nothing. In the end, she would awake from her nightmare without her right arm, which had been severed above the elbow in a car accident. The trauma of the event proved life-altering for Nguyen, who was 22 at the time. She went on to make a series of bad decisions that affected herself, her family and her friends in ways she regretted for years to come.   In time, Nguyen realized that one day she would have to create her own change or her life would not get better.   ""When one day became my day one, I took responsibility for my life and decided to be better, not bitter,” Nguyen relates. ""I realized that focusing on losing my arm was keeping me from focusing on the good things in my life. I took action using a five-step process, which I now use to help others discover how to be better versions of themselves.”  One Arm But Not Unarmed is Nguyen's empowering look at how she overcame bitterness and adversity, and eventually emerged with renewed determination to live her best life. This insightful book aims to help other trauma victims navigate life's peaks and valleys through strategies for making good decisions, transforming their emotional responses to life's inevitable ebb and flow, and ultimately knowing and living their purpose. Are you ready for one day to become day one?  Author Suzan Nguyen was born and raised in Port Arthur, Texas. She now lives in the Houston area and enjoys life with her husband, Phu, who is a talented chef. Nguyen is a transformative speaker and life coach who began the #bebetter movement in 2017. She completed classes at the Institute of Professional Excellence in Coaching, is a certified Happiness Chief Encouragement Officer, and is deeply fulfilled by helping others through telling her story, transforming perspectives, and shedding light on the journey all trauma victims experience.

5000g000028bZvZAAU,The Church Shooting The News Never Covered...,"There is a simple reason why this incident was not covered my even a single new outlet....  Friend, on Easter Sunday a few years ago a door greeter at a church spotted the barrel of a gun sticking out of a mans jacket as he entered.  She immediately radioed the security team that there was an armed intruder heading for the balcony. Knowing that they had a possible active shooter situation on their hands, the security team raced to the balcony and confronted the intruder.  There they found the intruder...armed with a rifle.  An armed intruder on the balcony of the sanctuary. With everyone's back to this man, he would have every advantage he needed to inflict as much damage as possible.  This was a horrific...nightmare of a situation.  Fortunately, due to the quick actions of this well-trained door greeter and security team, this man surrendered without a single shot being fired.  The reason a shooting was never reported, is because the shooting was stopped before it had a chance to start.  Having a proper security foundation saves lives.

5000g000028bRn5AAE,The Helsinki Effect: Public Alternatives to the Guggenheim Model of Culture-Driven Development   - (REVIEW COPY? INTERVIEW REQUESTS?),"View this email in your browser (https://mailchi.mp/0cac38effd55/the-helsinki-effect-public-alternatives-to-the-guggenheim-model-of-culture-driven-development-review-copy-interview-requests-2395913?e=fca32058da)   ** ------------------------------------------------------------  Helsinki is the chosen site for the Guggenheim Museum’s latest effort to replicate the much-contested “Bilbao Effect.” Advocates of better methods for fusing the arts and urbanism combined to launch an alternative design competition in 2015. The Next Helsinki helped to amplify a public debate about the role of culture in civic health and economic development that has consequences far beyond the Finnish case-study.  In addition to cataloging the hundreds of entries from dozens of countries, this volume includes essays by leading urbanists, artists, and architects about the significance of the competition and the principles that inspired it.   Editors: Terike Haapoja, Andrew Ross, and Michael Sorkin  Contributors: Miguel Robles-Durán; Terike Haapoja; Juhani Pallasmaa; Andrew Ross; Michael Sorkin; Kaarin Taipale; Mabel Wilson; Sharon Zukin  Reviews:  ""Responding to a competition for the design of a new Guggenheim Museum in Helsinki, the authors contributing to this volume deconstruct the values underlying use of the arts to promote economic competitiveness. The uniqueness of this edited book lies in its focus on the commodification of artistic achievement and the ensuing failure to foster local creativity. In investigating the impact of brand-name institutions on construction labor, art markets, and city life, it is an important addition to the critical urban studies literature."" --- Susan S. Fainstein, Senior Research Fellow, Harvard Graduate School of Design  ""The Next Helsinki showed that there is great potential for imagining a lively, attractive city that grows out of the unique culture of the region. The Helsinki Effect opens a needed view to global conversations in city planning and art. Recommended reading for everybody interested in art, Helsinki, or both! --- Ilona Anhava, gallerist, Gallery Anhava, Helsinki  ""At a moment when the neoliberal politics and economics of urban development continue uninterrupted, expanding social inequality and cultural exclusion, The Helsinki Effect is an urgent call for a new public imagination. This book challenges the widespread belief that privatizing public resources and urban sites is the only pathway to economic progress; and it insists that the internationalization of cultural management must be contested in order to re-invent the contemporary art museum in the 21st century.  More than ever, mega-cultural institutions should be responsible for connecting international art economies with local cultural productivity, mediating top-down and bottom-up urban dynamics, and stimulating alternative strategies for constructing more just and inclusive cities."" -- Teddy Cruz and Fonna Forman, University of California, San Diego, Estudio Teddy Cruz + Forman   ""Through the 'Bilbao Effect,' art becomes a luxury commodity, the museum becomes an exclusionary enclave of private enjoyment, and the city becomes a speculative playground for global capital, embellished through architectural extravagance.  This book reports on recent struggles among artists, architects, urbanists and activists in Helsinki and beyond to counteract the use of culture as a means of privatizing and enclosing urban life.  Against the ultra-luxury, corporate-elite fantasies of Guggenheim Helsinki, the counter-proposals for The Next Helsinki documented here reflect not only a more inclusionary, radically democratic approach to the role of art in public life.  They also chart out alternatives to the neoliberal city, based on the vision of the urban as a commons—produced, shared, appropriated and transformed by all."" --- Neil Brenner, Professor of Urban Theory at the Harvard Graduate School of Design.

5000g000028bAXpAAM,"Re: After mass shootings, Republicans wrestle with politics of race","Why is it that the WSJ this morning in an editorial, cited the backgrounds of both shooters, while the CSM only comments on the El Paso shooter’s right wing rants, while making no comment re the Dayton shooter’s “leftist ravings”? And I believe the CSM went to press considerably later than the print edition of the WSJ. I agree with the WSJ comment that “it is disheartening to see how quickly the issue of these two highly disturbed shooters was overwhelmed by the urge to assign political causation”.  I found it discouraging to again see the CSM not really presenting an even-handed analysis of a situation that needs it.

The first African American woman to win a Nobel Prize in literature (1993) died Monday. Her novels lyrically and unflinchingly plumbed slavery, sisterhood, racism, justice, sexual abuse, rage, guilt, and liberty. She’s “a national treasure <https://www.facebook.com/barackobama/photos/a.10155401589571749/10156901908101749/?type=3&theater> ... ,” wrote former President Barack Obama today, “a challenge to our conscience and a call to greater empathy.” > She leaves an indelible mark on America <https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/2019/0806/Author-Toni-Morrison-remembered-for-her-visionary-force> and a generation of black writers. I asked Monitor culture critic Candace McDuffie what Ms. Morrison means to her.  > “Toni Morrison made me feel valued and seen in a genre where we are usually neglected,” writes Candace in an email. “In white American literature, black women are either completely ignored or reduced to racist tropes. We are not docile Mammys, nor are we hypersexual Jezebels or inexplicably angry Sapphires. We are multidimensional and beautiful beings whose experiences run deep. Morrison managed to embody our complexities through works that showcased our humanity and wholeness.” > Candace respects that Ms. Morrison “never jeopardized her artistic integrity. ...

Read > As the nation grapples with the aftermath of two horrific mass shootings – one allegedly committed by an avowed white supremacist – the Republican Party has been engaging in a kind of soul-searching of its own.   > Many leading Republican politicians, including several from states with large Latino populations, have made a point of calling out “white supremacy” by name and urging others in their party to take an unequivocal stance. > Other top Republicans haven’t joined the chorus, however, instead blaming mental illness and video games for the actions of mass shooters. And while some in the party see an urgent need to take a strong moral stand, others see a political trap – since many Democrats are arguing that it is hypocritical for any Republican to denounce white supremacy unless he or she also denounces President Donald Trump. > Still, the shift in thought is significant, observers say. Fighting white supremacy will require leaders from both sides of the aisle to consistently and specifically condemn it wherever it emerges, says Cynthia Miller-Idriss, an American University professor who studies far-right youth extremism.  > “I do think this is a genuine shift happening,” Ms. Miller-Idriss says. “We’re seeing a much stronger condemnation now than we have in the past.” > By Jessica Mendoza > By Linda Feldmann > Read 5 min. <https://www.csmonitor.com/Daily/2019/20190806?cmpid=ema:bundle:20190806&src=email&id=1093663> > ( 1201 words ) >  <https://click.cssubs.com/?qs=9837885a621ff901b5503391d76d984d1a66f06a5b0a72eccdb6276f55ffcc3f17532e345ab1546cfd42a7f7aa0f98d7dcab06e2291347be>  <https://click.cssubs.com/?qs=9837885a621ff90134619921283295ba0fc8884865fbe45c3ee694f65c116919cab5abd2d99ea192746c4105ae5264e2919c93ddd3bf9b84>  <mailto:?subject=I+think+you%27ll+like+this+article+from+the+Monitor+Daily&body=Here's%20the%20article%20on%20CSMonitor.com:+%0A%0A+After%20mass%20shootings,%20Republicans%20wrestle%20with%20politics%20of%20race+%0A%0A+https://www.csmonitor.com/Daily/2019/20190806/After-mass-shootings-Republicans-wrestle-with-politics-of-race?src=shared+%0A%0A+You%20can%20try%20the%20Monitor%20Daily%20free%20for%20a%20week:%20https://www.csmonitor.com/dailyfreetrial> > 2.

Our reporter looks at their response.  > – David > The 30 Sec. Read > Thirty-five years ago, Sven Stroosma was a University of Washington student looking for a summer job. He wound up salmon fishing – and fell in love with the business. > Today, Mr. Stroosma and his deckhands – two sons, a nephew, and a friend – fish the blue waters of the Gulf of Alaska, using a net that hangs 100 feet deep. It’s dangerous and demanding work. Amid a U.S.-China trade war, which includes Chinese tariffs on Alaskan seafood, it’s tough financially, too. Last year, Mr. Stroosma says, chum salmon brought in 90 cents per pound. Now, it’s only 50.  > Washington state is the most trade-dependent state in the country, with about 40% of all jobs linked to international commerce; Alaska and Oregon are also among the most affected states. Meanwhile, the trade war seems to have no end in sight. President Donald Trump announced a 10% tariff on another $300 billion of Chinese imports last week.  > So what do you do when you’re caught in the middle? Pacific Northwest lawmakers have lobbied the administration to provide relief for the fishing industry, as it has for farmers. Mr. Stroosma, for one, has mixed feelings about any government relief. > “Fishermen – probably very similarly to farmers – we are very independent,” he says.  > By Ann Scott Tyson > Read 7 min. <https://www.csmonitor.com/Daily/2019/20190806?cmpid=ema:bundle:20190806&src=email&id=1093664> > ( 1493 words ) >  <https://click.cssubs.com/?qs=9837885a621ff9016cbfdfadd8866c6c99c60f28d5241dbe8a6410c3ede5027f36e01a4cb9fce32e49d43166eae78011c4ac77606e2910fc>  <https://click.cssubs.com/?qs=9837885a621ff90189acd4d1da2320908d1075953d8b049ba60a203384a6d604ebff283fa10e8b449bffd1d31fbed412f416c607e8be1688>  <mailto:?subject=I+think+you%27ll+like+this+article+from+the+Monitor+Daily&body=Here's%20the%20article%20on%20CSMonitor.com:+%0A%0A+For%20Northwest%20fishermen,%20latest%20catch%20is%20trade-war%20trouble+%0A%0A+https://www.csmonitor.com/Daily/2019/20190806/For-Northwest-fishermen-latest-catch-is-trade-war-trouble?src=shared+%0A%0A+You%20can%20try%20the%20Monitor%20Daily%20free%20for%20a%20week:%20https://www.csmonitor.com/dailyfreetrial> > 3.

And to many women fighting to change that, their battle felt like an invisible one – until this winter. > Anger finally burst into the open as high-profile cases piled up, particularly against children. Soon, President Julius Maada Bio took the unprecedented step of declaring sexual violence a national emergency, and urged half a dozen reforms. “My government will ensure that men who rape have no place in society and will be jailed forever,” he declared, “so that a single rape becomes the last rape.” > But since then, activists’ initial elation has turned to frustration. Lawmakers have rescinded the national emergency. And advocates say there’s been little in the way of real resources or change. > It’s a setback, for sure. But what Sierra Leone’s experience also underscores is where the most important work against gender-based violence needs to happen: at home, in schools, in neighborhoods. Top-down decrees begin with bottom-up education. > After the decree, “more families will step forward to get justice,” says Vickie Remoe, a blogger and activist.

French special forces are working closely with Mr. Zapata, a former jet-ski world champion, to fine-tune his machine. “Innovation is not a gimmick,” said Defense Minister Florence Parly of the hoverboard, which she suggested could function as “a flying logistics platform, or an assault platform,” conjuring an image of squadrons of individually airborne infantry descending on an enemy. > But that will take time. “That’s because [the Flyboard] has limited autonomy, it is hardly inconspicuous, and it is difficult to fly,” says Marion Laguës, spokeswoman for the French Defense Innovation Agency. “It is the development prospects that are interesting.” > By Peter Ford > @peterfordcsm <https://twitter.com/peterfordcsm?cmpid=ema:bundle:20190806&src=email> > Read 3 min. <https://www.csmonitor.com/Daily/2019/20190806?cmpid=ema:bundle:20190806&src=email&id=1093674> > ( 608 words ) >  <https://click.cssubs.com/?qs=9837885a621ff901ca3886ae77783fc284448bbcd76cbe040a919e87c84fa7e4648d7fe5cbfc905c30d8167848b8ba841d30cff700522928>  <https://click.cssubs.com/?qs=9837885a621ff901e19df76f877d68a3e0b321623d8b3f6165dd540ea2bb11c9c48f470deaadca3cb6678922547b3c4e4f4a00512a67d0e4>  <mailto:?subject=I+think+you%27ll+like+this+article+from+the+Monitor+Daily&body=Here's%20the%20article%20on%20CSMonitor.com:+%0A%0A+Not%20just%20a%20toy:%20Channel-hopping%20hoverboard%20draws%20military%E2%80%99s%20eye+%0A%0A+https://www.csmonitor.com/Daily/2019/20190806/Not-just-a-toy-Channel-hopping-hoverboard-draws-military-s-eye?src=shared+%0A%0A+You%20can%20try%20the%20Monitor%20Daily%20free%20for%20a%20week:%20https://www.csmonitor.com/dailyfreetrial> > THE MONITOR'S VIEW > The latest lesson in how to end a conflict > The 30 Sec.

I'm following up about How To Raise A Reader (Workman; September 3, 2019) by New York Times book editors - and both mothers of three - Pamela Paul and Maria Russo. I sent a copy your way and am excited to hear your thoughts, especially as we head into the back to school and holiday seasons! Complete with a gorgeous, hardcover package, it's the perfect gift for any parent that's eager to instill a lifelong love of reading in their child.  It's an accepted fact that reading is crucial for kids. Study after study shows babies and toddlers thrive intellectually and emotionally when they're read to, and that books help children of every age expand their language skills and comprehension of the world, boost their critical thinking and imagination, build empathy, and strengthen bonds with caregivers. At the same time, reading can be a source of stress for parents: ""Which books should I read to my baby, and how early? Is my child reading soon enough, fast enough, in an advanced enough way?

School is where children learn how to read. Home is where they can learn to love reading.  I've also copied some more very insightful Reading Myths below along with additional information on Pamela and Maria, who are both available for interview.  Looking forward to hearing from you soon and hope you have a lovely weekend,  Happy reading,  Chloe associate director of publicity I workman publishing   Six Popular Myths About Childhood Reading, Debunked  Myth: Reading aloud to my child is the most important factor in making sure they grow up to be a strong reader. Reality: Reading to your child is incredibly important, for all kinds of reasons. But recent studies show that having lots of books in the home is just as important. A child who's surrounded by books is very likely to grow up to be a reader. If the adults in the home are reading their own books and enjoying them, too, all the better.  Myth: The earlier a child learns to read independently, the better a reader he will be for life. Reality: The age your child learns to read is not actually related to future reading skills or overall cognitive ability. Every kid learns to read on a highly personal schedule - that's why in many European countries, reading instruction doesn't even begin until age 7 or 8 as many children's brains -- and especially boys' -- are not ready for decoding (an essential part of reading) until then. Often, the best and most voracious readers start reading later, when they can comprehend more sophisticated material that catches their interest and inspires them to read more.  Myth: Reading the same book over and over means your child is stuck. Reality: We benefit from re-reading at every age. Babies and toddlers profit from hearing books read over and over (and over) as they begin to understand the meanings tied to the sounds and recognize cadences and familiarize themselves with the words. Older children benefit emotionally and cognitively from re-reading and revisiting their ""comfort books."" And often deeper themes will only make themselves known after a second reading. This is true of adults as well; many like to read a book or see a movie a second or third time, not only to enjoy it again, but also to appreciate it more.  Myth: Parents should work with their children, starting in preschool, to teach them to read, then help them progress year by year. Reality: School is where children learn to read. Home is where children learn to love to read. It's not a parent's job to teach their child to read. Rather than asking ""When will he start reading?"" or ""What reading level is he on?"" parents should instead ask ""How can I help him want to read?,"" ""What books will she truly enjoy?"" and ""how can we as a family enjoy reading together?"" Prodding and pressuring a child whose brain not ready to read is not only futile but it can create negative associations around books. Approach reading as a pleasure delivery system and you're more likely to be successful.  Myth: I can't wait to read Harry Potter to my child! Reality: Harry Potter is fantastic. But there's no reason to rush to these books; children will get to them when they are ready. The first Harry Potter book was written for ages 8 to 12. The later books are meant for ages 10 and up. Parents don't need to push Harry Potter in any way or prove that your child is ""old enough"" for Harry. Let children get to Harry Potter on their own.  Myth: Once they're reading chapter books independently, it's time to move on from picture books. Reality:  Picture books are works of art and are perfect vehicles to deliver rich storytelling. Just as a parent would want their child to appreciate the artwork in museums, they can invite them to embark on a lifetime of appreciating art in books. Picture books should stay in the picture all through childhood - and beyond. And once a child begins to read independently, parents should still hold on to illustrated books of all kinds -- including graphic novels, which are increasingly popular for many reasons, not least because they are one of the best ways to teach a reluctant reader (or any reader) how to appreciate story. And remember: coffee table books are picture books for people of all ages.    [cid:image002.jpg@01D54DFD.F13FE9E0]Maria Russo is the children's books editor of the New York Times Book Review.

It is so good to remember and affirm that we all were created in God’s image so we all reflect His nature at all times, even when it doesn’t seem apparent and that divine Love’s permanent light stomps out any sense of fear, darkness, anger and destruction.

Her list of platinum and gold was to be matched only by her awards and accolades. CMA's ""Female Vocalist of the Year,"" for two consecutive years, she became a Grammy® Award Winner for ""Best Female Vocal Performance,"" thanks to her beloved ""Brown Eyes"" - a song that she today admits she has never grown tired of singing. Crystal swept the Academy of Country Music Awards for three of their ""Top Female Vocalist"" statuettes. She is the recipient of three ""American Music Awards,"" voted by the nation as America's ""Favorite Female Artist."" Perhaps nothing sums up Crystal's career achievements as well as being awarded with a star on the fabled Hollywood Walk of Fame in October 2009. Also famous for her nearly floor-length hair, she was voted one of the 50 most beautiful people in the world by People Magazine in 1983. Gayle also has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame near Lynn's star. In August 2016, the Academy of Country Music honored Crystal with the Cliffie Stone Pioneer Award during the 10th Annual ACM Honors. Gayle was inducted into the Grand Ole Opry in January 2017 by her sister and Opry legend Loretta Lynn.

More than 60 guest artists join Alphabet Rockers co-founders, Kaitlin McGaw and Tommy Soulati Shepherd, along with voices from the Rockers’ next generation: Lillian Ellis, Maya Fleming, Kali de Jesus and Tommy “T3PO” Shepherd III.   The Alphabet Rockers are known for crafting songs for young change-makers, and these new and original anthems evolved out of extensive listening sessions and community conversations. As McGaw explains, “Hundreds of kids and families trusted us with their lived experience to write these songs. These are songs of self love and justice for trans and gender non-binary kids and families, and inspiration for anyone who wants to be an ally.”  Adds Shepherd, “Making this music allowed me to notice my own blind spots. Like everyone, I want to do better. When we understand there are people out there who need our advocacy, we can be culture-keepers. We can change. Alphabet Rockers music is for ALL people.”  Recognizing that the album was recorded on land originally inhabited by the Ohlone people, Alphabet Rockers begin*The LOVE* with a series of positive statements, led Kanyon ""CoyoteWoman"" Sayers-Rood. Each of the following songs reflects and honors diverse identities within our society, bringing visibility to those that are often silenced.  Standouts include the big and fully realized hit single “Not Alone” (about how to be an ally and stand up for friends), “We Royal” (celebrating  trans, gender non-conforming and two-spirit heroes),  “Live Your Life,” (a promise to make the world safe for all people), “Black Grxl Magic” (featuring several young Rockers), and “I Am Enough” (featuring the Singing Bois). Latin Grammy winner 123 Andrés and acclaimed hip hop artist SaulPaul are guests on “Until You’re Free,” which includes the line, “I’m not free until you’re free.” The anthemic “Just Be” is for all people who want to live their truth without fear, and “Someday” speaks to interrupting violence and standing up to hate. It calls on listeners to be #TheLOVE.   *The LOVE* was produced at Zoo Labs in Oakland, CA, in collaboration with GRAMMY-winning producer Street Symphony and several other producers and engineers. Alphabet Rockers will perform several Bay Area shows including headlining the Art & Soul Festival this summer. In September, they will host an album release concert at Oakland Pride and will appear at the inaugural Building Bridges Family Music Festival in Portland. The Alphabet Rockers also recently launched the So Get Me podcast <https://soundcloud.com/alphabetrockers/sets/so-get-me-alphabet-rockers> for families making change.

5000g000028bDVeAAM,Tips for Parents to Manage Fear and Anxiety as Kids go Back to School,"Hi Stephanie,  As September nears, so does fear and anxiety for parents who have to entrust the safety and well-being of their kids to schools.   John J. Murphy (http://www.johnjmurphy.org/) , a speaker, spiritual mystic, ""zentrepreneur,” and award-winning author has tips for parents to overcome a fear-based mindset, adopt a miracle-minded way of thinking, and find inner peace when faced with challenging situations: Let be, let go, let see, and let flow.   “People all over the world are stressed,” says Murphy. “More importantly, people are stressed and they are not aware it is a condition of their own making. The ego mindset is projecting a negative outcome or possibility onto the future and when we dwell on what could go wrong, we feel anxious and afraid. These negative assumptions, projected by the mind, are triggering fear and stress. It is like being nervous before giving a speech or taking an exam. We are nervous because we ‘think’ something might go wrong. Mindful parenting is essential to helping mothers and fathers see things differently - by teaching them to see in a different way, a miracle-minded way.”    Murphy is available for bylines and interviews to elaborate on this topic and his tips. Are you interested in scheduling content?  Thanks in advance for your consideration and feedback.  Have a great day,  Joelle  John J. Murphy is a global business consultant, speaker, spiritual mystic, ""zentrepreneur,” and award-winning author.He is Founder (1988) and CEO of Venture Management Consultants, Inc., a firm specializing in creating lean, high performance work environments.  As a business consultant, Murphy has delivered services to some of the world’s leading organizations, including ADP, AlliedSignal (Honeywell), BMW, Chase, the CIA, GE, GM, GSK, Hilton, Lockheed Martin, Merck, the Michigan State Senate, Perrigo, Prudential, Raytheon, Spectrum Health, Target Stores, Teva, and the US Navy. As an educator and Lean Six Sigma Master Black Belt, Murphy has trained thousands of people from over 50 countries, including Fortune 500 executives, project leaders, military leaders, managers, and black belts. He has mentored dozens of project teams in Organizational Development, Operational Excellence, Business Process Innovation and Lean Six Sigma applications. As a speaker, Murphy has delivered keynotes and seminars worldwide. A critically-acclaimed authority on peak performance, transformational leadership and healthy mind-body-spirit, Murphy is a best-selling author who has published 19 books and appeared on over 400 radio and television stations and his work has been featured in over 50 newspapers nationwide.

Here’s a sneak peak:  * A major vulnerability has been discovered in arguably the world's most used database engine, said to be used more than all of the other database engines COMBINED. It is used by all the popular browsers, major operating systems, desktops, and Python.... iPhones, Dropbox, Skype...  * Critical vulnerabilities have been discovered that affect modern cameras, many of which include household names. The combination of price, sensitive contents, and a wide-spread consumer audience makes cameras a lucrative target for attackers and Check Point has discovered that these cameras have the potential to be infected through the use of WiFi or by hijacking a PC.  Please let me know if of interest as I’d be happy to share more details under embargo or connect you with a Check Point executive to explain the implications of these vulnerabilities.   Thanks so much for your time & hope to hear from you.  Liza Vilnits Publicist | Check Point  checkpoint@prhacker.com ",8/7/2019 0:00,,,Junk,,,FALSE,

5000g000028bbD2AAI,Neither: Anti- or Pro...,"Being neither Pro nor Anti-  firing arms, shouldn’t congress be discussing a constitutional amendment update, clarifying the 2nd amendment? It is nebulous and confusing, written in an era of single-shot unrifled long-guns, long  before revolvers & automatic pistols existed. Most deaths in the US are pistol suisides. The original idea behind the 2nd amendment was for individuals to be able to defend their home, to include warding off an out of control central government. There was no intention for innocent people to be killed indiscriminately by the mentally unstable, whereby today abusers utilize drugs.   Since we do not want Congress to take away our rights, nor want more innocent people endangered, our forefathers gave us a way to solve the problem. Have a serious discussion today, by way of a constitutional amendment. If we cannot agree on interpretation, leave it the way it is.  While the Press expresses sensationalized events, we continue to wish for Congress to not take away our rights, yet  maintain harmlessness to innocent people, not be endangered. Our forefathers gave us a way to solve the problem during that period of time. Agree now on a modern interpretation where domestically we have the right to bear arms for protection, with restrictions in mindful constraint, allowing only authorities to Carry concealed and publicly, and to freely explore and exploit potential violators, leaving law the way it has been written.  -The people have spoken.  --  To unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to daily+unsubscribe@csps.com.",8/9/2019 0:00,,,Junk,,,FALSE,

5000g000028bQPQAA2,"ALONG THE TRENCHES: A Journey through Eastern Europe to Isfahan, by Navid Kermani -  (REVIEW COPY? INTERVIEW REQUESTS?)","Publishing December 6, 2019   ** ------------------------------------------------------------  Between Germany and Russia is a region strewn with monuments to the horrors of war, genocide and disaster – the bloodlands where the murderous regimes of Hitler and Stalin unleashed the violence that scarred the twentieth century and shaped so much of the world we know today. In September 2016 the German-Iranian writer Navid Kermani set out to discover this land and to travel along the trenches that are now re-emerging in Europe, from his home in Cologne through eastern Germany to the Baltics, and from there south to the Caucasus and to Isfahan in Iran, the home of his parents.  Along the way he meets the citizens of Schwerin, in north-eastern Germany, who have gathered in a restaurant for coffee and cake at the invitation of the Alternative für Deutschland, the far-right anti-immigration party, and listens to them talking about their fears of becoming losers in their own country, their interests overlooked while their government gives priority to helping refugees and asylum seekers among others; he travels to Paneriai, 10 kilometers from the centre of Vilnius in what is now Lithuania, where, in June 1941, thousands of Jews were rounded up by the SS and Lithuanian volunteer units, taken into the woods and shot; he drives through the lands around Chernobyl where hundreds of towns and villages once stood, with their schools and shops and community centres, and now only a handful of people remain, their houses torn down when they die.  This beautifully written travel diary, enlivened by conversations with the people Kermani meets along the way, brings to life the tragic history of these troubled lands and shows how this history leaves its traces in the present. It will be of great interest to anyone concerned with current affairs and with the events that have shaped, and continue to shape, the world in which we live today.  The Author:  Navid Kermani is a writer and scholar who lives in Cologne, Germany. He has received numerous accolades for his literary and academic work, including the 2015 Peace Prize of the German Publishers’ Association, Germany’s most prestigious cultural award.   Reviews:  “A book so moving and so powerful that’s it’s worth taking 54 days over it, so that each day you can immerse yourself in a new world.” NRD  “A breathtaking travel diary and a passionate plea for the diversity of cultures, for Europe and the beauty of stories.” Bayrischer Rundfunk  “On almost every page there is something for the reader to think about, to learn, to marvel at.” Tages-Anzeiger  “Kermani has succeeded in writing a stirring plea for Europe, one which confirms his place among the ranks of Germany’s most influential intellectuals.” Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung  For review copy and interview requests please contact:  Lucas Jones North American Publicity lucasjones@politybooks.com 9522154807  ============================================================ ** (http://www.twitter.com/) ** (http://www.facebook.com) ** (http://mailchimp.com) Copyright © 2019 Lucas Jones, All rights reserved.  .

5000g000028bc0QAAQ,Current Issues class,"Hello, I’m writing as a Social Studies teacher at the Principia Upper School. This semester I’m teaching a Current Issues course and I would like the students to focus primarily on articles from The Christian Science Monitor. I notice that the students would only be able to access 3 articles unless they have a digital subscription. I’m wondering if there are reduced rates or free subscriptions for students? I have less than 10 students in the class and it is only one semester, so the access would be for September-November. My hope would be that the deep dive into news through the CS Monitor would encourage them to be subscribers on their own in the future. Thank you for letting me know the subscription options for the CS Monitor use in class.

5000g000028bdwEAAQ,Tom Steyer to Address Presidential Gun Sense Forum via Video,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: Saturday, August 10, 2019 CONTACT: press@tomsteyer.com Tom Steyer to Address Presidential Gun Sense Forum via Video  (Des Moines, IA, August 10, 2019) — Today, in a prerecorded address (https://youtu.be/B-3SwHqrKdo) , Democratic presidential candidate Tom Steyer joined the Presidential Gun Sense Forum organized by the Everytown for Gun Safety Action Fund, in Des Moines, Iowa. In the video Steyer directly addressed the complicit role of the NRA and GOP in the most recent tragedies.  “When we see tragic events like the ones we saw in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, it can make us sad. It should make us feel sympathy for our fellow Americans, but we shouldn’t be surprised,” said Steyer in the video. “This is the absolute result of political corruption. The gun manufacturers through the NRA control the Republican Party and this president and they’ve prevented common sense gun legislation.""  Steyer is not attending the forum due to a scheduling conflicts, but he wholeheartedly believes in the work several organizations are doing in trying to achieve sensible gun reform, especially those seeking to ban assault weapons and restricting high-capacity magazines.  In the past, a Steyer-founded organization, NextGen America, partnered with Giffords, Everytown for Gun Safety, and ACRONYM to launch Our Lives, Our Vote, a program that empowered high school-aged Americans to vote out politicians beholden to the NRA by registering their peers to vote.  Tom Steyer supports universal background checks, red flag laws, banning assault weapons, and restricting high-capacity magazines. He supports prohibitions on 3D firearm printing, and banning gun possession for those who have been convicted of domestic violence. Tom thinks that gun manufacturers should not be immune from civil liability, and would support funding to study gun violence as a public health issue. He also supports federal databases to track gun sales, and opposes concealed carry reciprocity.  Paid for Tom Steyer 2020.   ###  About Tom:  Tom Steyer left his successful investing business seven years ago to give his own money and all his time and energy to fighting for progressive causes. He soon became one of the country’s leading forces in registering more young voters and voters of color, fighting climate change, working for racial justice, and helping secure better lives for all Americans. Tom has led a number of people-first, grassroots campaigns that have repeatedly defeated powerful special interests, beating big oil to win clean air laws, forcing big tobacco to pay its share of healthcare costs, and closing a billion-dollar corporate tax loophole to fund public schools.  Tom and his wife Kat Taylor were early signers of the Giving Pledge, a commitment to give the bulk of his fortune to good causes before they die. Tom’s dedication to doing what is right comes from his parents. His father was a lawyer who prosecuted Nazis at the Nuremberg Trials; his mother was a journalist and teacher who volunteered to teach prisoners in New York City jails. Tom says his parents showed him the power of having the courage to do the right thing. Their greatest lesson, he says, was that our actions speak louder than our words – what we do is more important than what we say.  ============================================================ Tom Steyer 2020 | P.O.

5000g000028bfqIAAQ,Libby's 2018 healing.docx,"Hello, my friend Libby Weir has tried and tried to submit this via the  submit a testimony via  https://jsh.christianscience.com/submit/manuscript-submission several  times as I have as well and it drops out. So here it is. If you could  please forward it to the jsh for publication we would be most grateful   Sancy Nason, +61 409 465 531    Libby Weir/ +61 403 629 625 libbywei@yahoo.com.au    I would like to submit this testimony for consideration for  publication, as it was so meaningful for me.   I have studied this life transforming Science my entire life. During  that time, I have witnessed and experienced countless proofs of  healing. Many  of these have come about quickly. Others  have required  persistence, and have compelled spiritual growth before being  realised.   However it was not until late in the year 2017, that I was challenged  in a way I have never been before.   On Christmas Day of that year, I was aware of persistent pain in my  right arm. I did nothing about it, expecting it to pass. However  during the following week, the pain spread to my other arm, my hips,  and then to both of my legs. Before long I was experiencing extreme  pain, in all my muscles and joints and bones, and I was forced to  severely curtail my activities.   I gave up my morning run, and before long I was having trouble  climbing the stairs in my home, getting in and out of bed, and even  sitting in any chair that was below a certain height. Getting in and  out of the car became challenging, and even raising my arms to the  steering wheel, required much exertion. All this was accompanied by an  extreme weight loss.   I initially felt no fear, as I was so confident in the power of God  to overcome any adverse condition. However as the weeks dragged in to  months, and there was no improvement, I began to feel anxious.   Despite knowing intellectually that I was not dealing with a real  condition, rather a false belief, I found myself wondering what  “it” was, and what  had caused it.  Someone very close to me had battled with very similar symptoms and  had subsequently passed on, and I found myself remembering this  vividly, as I had nursed him during much of this time.  I knew it was essential that I overcome both the fear, and the vivid  images of this loved one’s suffering, images that I had not realised  I was still harbouring.  I was able to continue working, and did not tell anyone of my  challenge, except two practitioners who, lovingly worked with me at  different times.   Whilst not working, or being with my family, my entire time was spent  nurturing a sincere desire to feel closer to God, and to better  understand my relationship with Him.   I had to learn much needed lessons in humility. I had always prided  myself on being fit and energetic, and even felt a little smug, when  friends and acquaintances around me were undergoing hip and knee  replacements, being thankful that I would never have to succumb to  either. I was compelled to see that these people were also,  in their  true being, intact and free from all sense of decline.   I pondered deeply, a much loved statement from Science and Health,  page 283, line 4, which reads “Mind is the source of all movement,  and there is no inertia to retard or check it’s perpetual and  harmonious action.” This assured me that movement had its source in  Mind, not in muscles, therefore it could not be impaired.   Whilst driving, or simply trying to climb the stairs I clung to  another favourite passage from the same textbook. “ All that God  imparts moves in accord with Him, reflecting goodness and  power.”  (Pg 515, line 22.) I constantly challenged the insidious suggestions  of deterioration  and incapacity. I affirmed that power was not a  personal possession, rather it was a reflected attribute.   Nights were very difficult, due to the pain,  and my sleep was often  disturbed. However, I slowly progressed from dreading the long   wakeful nights, to learning to really appreciate the stillness and  solitude as I became so aware of God’s presence and His intimate  care for me.   Many nights I would have only four or five hours sleep, but  I was  always able to rise the following morning feeling rested and  untroubled.   After several months, I found myself becoming very discouraged. I  would have periods of such clarity and spiritual assurance, followed  by disappointment when I failed to see physical improvement. Again and  again I needed to remind myself that I did not need to look to matter  to determine my wellbeing. I also knew that when my trust  in my  oneness with God became unshakeable, I would have no need to look to  matter to have my soundness verified.   In May of the same year I was due to fly to Africa, to resume aid  work which I have been undertaking for many years. This deadline  loomed large in my thought. I simply could not imagine how I could  undergo such a long flight, let alone accomplish  the physical work  demanded of me there.   Many times I felt I should postpone the trip, but I knew the work was  important, and felt strongly that I should be there. I prayed for  boldness and courage.   As the date approached there was still very little physical  improvement. A practitioner lovingly supported me during the flight,  and I was conscious of leaning on God, every step of the way. On  several occasions, strangers offered to help with my luggage, and I  was given a seat which allowed me to get up easily, and move around  when I needed to.   As I settled in to my new routine in Africa, I felt a shift taking  place in my thought. All sense of discouragement had given way to a  certainty that I would be healed. Impatience gave way to trusting ‘  God’s disposal of events’. I was aware that I had finally  conquered all fear.   My biggest challenge was climbing the steep and rough track to the  rural village where I was working, and then descending the same track  at the end of the day. However, there was always a little child, or  someone around to assist. For many years they had been watching me  running up and down that track, but no one ever commented, or  questioned me.   One day while reading a Christian Science Journal article, I came  across this statement. “ The great Way- shower Illustrated  Life  unconfined, uncontaminated and untrammelled by matter.”   I looked up the meaning of untrammelled as I was not familiar with  it. One definition of it read “not deprived of freedom of action or  expression, not restricted or hampered.” This statement was so  relevant to me, and became uppermost in my thought daily.   The healing came slowly, almost imperceptibly. I became aware that I  was moving more freely. I was able to raise my arms to brush my hair.  I could sit in chairs that were a normal height, and then rise out of  them normally. I could turn over freely in bed, bend over, and pick  things up from the floor. By the time I had completed my three months  voluntary work in Africa, I was almost entirely free.   On returning home, other symptoms, such as swollen feet, and extreme  thirst disappeared. I also naturally regained my normal weight.   This healing required much mental discipline. I was forced to hold to  the truth vigorously, and at the same time refuse to be distracted by  the severity of the physical condition. I now look back on this as a  time of growth in grace and humility. I learnt needed lessons in  patience and persistence.  Above all, I took away from this  experience, the necessity for courage and boldness, and an unwavering  trust in the incontestable power of God.   Libby Weir.

5000g000028bC9cAAE,Re : csmonitor.com : Google Indexing Issues.,"Hi csmonitor.com,   I noticed something interesting while going through your website,   csmonitor.com .   It's apparent that you have used Adwords marketing to promote your business   in the past; however your website does see some organic search traffic here   and there. Now, I believe I can help increase that portion of organic   traffic significantly, at csmonitor.com.   I believe you would like to come top on searches for keywords related to:   csmonitor.com .. I found a number of SEO issues such as broken links, page   speed issue, HTML validation errors, and images with no ALT text on your   website, that's stopping you from getting that traffic.   How about I fix those, and also promote you through engaging content on   relevant places on the web (read, social media).  I guarantee you will see a drastic change in your search ranking and   traffic once these issues are fixed. Also, this is one time, so no paying   Adwords every month.   Is this something you are interested in? We have a very special offer for   the month of August 2019.   I also prepared a “Free Website Audit Report” for your website. If you are   interested i can show you the report.   I'd be happy to send you our package, pricing and past work details, if   you'd like to assess our work.   I look forward to hearing from you.

5000g000028awMZAAY,"The Return of the Russian Leviathan, by Sergei Medvedev  -  (REVIEW COPY? INTERVIEW REQUESTS?)","Publishing November 8, 2019   ** ------------------------------------------------------------  Russia’s relationship with its neighbours and with the West has worsened dramatically in recent years. Under Vladimir Putin’s leadership, the country has annexed Crimea, begun a war in East Ukraine, used chemical weapons on the streets of the UK and created an army of Internet trolls to meddle in the US presidential elections. How should we understand this apparent relapse into aggressive imperialism and militarism?  In this lively and well-informed account, the Russian sociologist and political scientist Sergei Medvedev sets out to explain the unexpected transformation of the country during Putin’s third term in office, from 2012 to 2018. He argues that this new wave of Russian nationalism is the result of mentalities that have long been embedded within the Russian psyche. Whereas in the West, the turbulent social changes of the 1960s and a rising awareness of the legacy of colonialism have modernized attitudes, Russia has been stymied by an enduring sense of superiority over its neighbours alongside a painful nostalgia for empire. It is this infantilized and irrational worldview that Putin and others have exploited, as seen most clearly in Russia’s recent foreign policy decisions. In the annexation of Crimea, Medvedev shows how patriotic rhetoric served to trump considerations of political or human cost. Inciting nationalist fervour may have been an effective way to consolidate Putin’s power within the Kremlin but it fractured relations with the West and it can only mask for so long the inability of the state to address the myriad of social and economic challenges facing Russia today.  This sharp and insightful book, full of irony and humour, shows how the archaic forces of imperial revanchism have been brought back to life, shaking Russian society and threatening the outside world. It will be of great interest to anyone trying to understand the forces shaping Russian politics and society.  The Author:  Sergei Medvedev is Professor in the Faculty of Social Sciences at the Higher School of Economics in Moscow. The host of several history and current affairs programmes on TV and radio and a regular commentator in the print, broadcasting and online media, he is one of Russia’s most in-demand public intellectuals.

5000g000028b3oCAAQ,Inspirational Show Guest / Review Request - One Arm But Not Unarmed,"Dear Stephanie Hanes :  One Arm But Not Unarmed is an empowering look at how one woman turned her own personal tragedy into a calling to help other trauma victims begin anew and ultimately become better versions of themselves. Suzan Nguyen was just 22 when she lost her right arm in a tragic accident. She spiraled downward and made a series of bad decisions before finding a way out of the darkness. Through One Arm But Not Unarmed, she shares her transformative five-step process for overcoming bitterness and adversity, and choosing to live your best life.  Here is a video that shows how to drop the draining depression and bounce back and enjoy life. As you can see, this author inspires! http://ascotmedianews.com/em/lt.php?c=18316&m=20677&nl=1198&s=f56e244f21aead307c5458b70ab88d81&lid=271958&l=-https--www.khou.com/mobile/video/news/give-mia-a-minute-july-3-2019-suzan-nguyen/285-af8fcd78-05af-4951-8413-57d73dd7da51     I would be happy to send you a complimentary copy of this deeply insightful book in consideration of an interview, review or feature.

Couldn't open her mouth. Couldn't even blink her eyes to signal to those standing over her. She could hear the sirens. See the flashing lights. But she felt nothing. In the end, she would awake from her nightmare without her right arm, which had been severed above the elbow in a car accident. The trauma of the event proved life-altering for Nguyen, who was 22 at the time. She went on to make a series of bad decisions that affected herself, her family and her friends in ways she regretted for years to come.   In time, Nguyen realized that one day she would have to create her own change or her life would not get better.   ""When one day became my day one, I took responsibility for my life and decided to be better, not bitter,” Nguyen relates. ""I realized that focusing on losing my arm was keeping me from focusing on the good things in my life. I took action using a five-step process, which I now use to help others discover how to be better versions of themselves.”  One Arm But Not Unarmed is Nguyen's empowering look at how she overcame bitterness and adversity, and eventually emerged with renewed determination to live her best life. This insightful book aims to help other trauma victims navigate life's peaks and valleys through strategies for making good decisions, transforming their emotional responses to life's inevitable ebb and flow, and ultimately knowing and living their purpose. Are you ready for one day to become day one?  Author Suzan Nguyen was born and raised in Port Arthur, Texas. She now lives in the Houston area and enjoys life with her husband, Phu, who is a talented chef. Nguyen is a transformative speaker and life coach who began the #bebetter movement in 2017. She completed classes at the Institute of Professional Excellence in Coaching, is a certified Happiness Chief Encouragement Officer, and is deeply fulfilled by helping others through telling her story, transforming perspectives, and shedding light on the journey all trauma victims experience.

Also here is the site of the Guastavino family home and tile production kilns as well as the senior Guastavino’s grave. The mission of the Guastavino Alliance is to champion the history and preservation of the Guastavinos’ over 1,000 works of vaulting and domes, which feature their unique structural tile method.  There are more than 600 extant Guastavino sites in 35 states and six countries. Our goal is to connect these sites in an alliance so that we may all work together in preservation, research, education, and advocacy of the Guastavinos' large body of work. We are anxious to share our experience and expertise with other sites and facilitate mutual sharing in many areas, including interpretive materials, publicity, social media, fundraising strategies, exhibits, grant opportunities, special events, conferences, lectures, etc.  A seminal event that led to the creation of the Guastavino Alliance was the donation by Dr. John Ochsendorf of the digital files for Palaces for the People (https://gmail.us3.list-manage.com/track/click?u=9a58e2cc8e26fb5162a68e7a0&id=da136eb99c&e=2783a28ad4) , an exhibit organized in 2012 as part of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Guastavino Project. All members of the Alliance are eligible to use these files for their own exhibits. Locally, we mounted an exhibit at the Swannanoa Valley Museum & History Center in Black Mountain, NC, which will will move to Pack Memorial Library in Asheville, NC, in September 2019. We are also designing a permanent outdoor exhibit in downtown Asheville.  Other benefits of membership in the Alliance include a periodic newsletter and the ability to purchase at reduced cost copies of Ochsendorf’s Guastavino Vaulting: The Art of Structural Tile. At this time we are not charging fees to join the Alliance, but welcome any donations to our 501c3 non-profit organization, which can be made online here (https://gmail.us3.list-manage.com/track/click?u=9a58e2cc8e26fb5162a68e7a0&id=7d9b4e4e3a&e=2783a28ad4) .  We are in the process of creating a website, which can be viewed in its beta form at https://gmail.us3.list-manage.com/track/click?u=9a58e2cc8e26fb5162a68e7a0&id=190929d040&e=2783a28ad4. It will include a full directory of Guastavino sites in the Alliance, a listing of resources available to Alliance members, and a news feed of Guastavino-related information.  I hope that your site will become a member of the Guastavino Alliance. I am happy to answer any questions you may have. Thank you for your consideration.

5000g000028bCtHAAU,"Story / tips (Boston author): How to become resilient, not bitter, when life is challenging","When her husband was arrested under shocking circumstances, author Diane Cook spiraled. Then she got MS. Here’s how she cut through the bitterness and grew resilient  Hi Stephanie? -  I thought you might be interested in the following story. Diane (a Boston-area resident) has penned an article and is also available for interview. Or let me know if you’d like to see a copy of her new book, So Many Angels (https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/wf/click?upn=G62jSYfZdO-2F12d8lSllQB9NiEmIXEWfdxPVBJGgLxaLXmCEu0yb-2FCXq7Ugo1COsPisWzUdi-2B730r5ZBLi-2Be8sRcrncy7JMcaODLR9uEqYZk-3D_6pchHAirW10eM8b14ZAlkZkRllITHdt0G4CIxpgEX-2FYMT-2FVtvkhkoxOwXdc140hQDKip1v9w6NG6f4yMNdzd3I0JbBoOspHl9BOjIgd0xs04I21YFduxE-2B8dkNLBpy8m8CLoOIU6HBz4Afn9ZyMR0Ap2OJvZiNrWVyuZ3V16eAsDadpFrQKryKKqazvt16fUH-2Boq1n-2BT8RE60rJkzIWt4Zec0gi63Gl3HlGabC-2FT5j9WBZqhBqbvOSQLVNZo1Xx0dL7cIOwKcBddCoSJkg7Qt0zE6eZGKpq-2FX3x6e5Cv0HG7s26Z16iU1TLB600ToU-2BxruvzZfyvyUYuytvAkvc0-2B423FxNZT70ku1WUA2IeXEE-3D , which tells her story in detail:  Over the past five years, words like “grit” and “resilience” have become trendy buzzwords that aim to provide a map for how to be successful, grow and change for the better.  But if resilience is the key to success, how do you cultivate it from scratch when something truly awful, something that demands the utmost resilience, happens out of nowhere?  Author Diane Stelfox Cook found herself staring this question dead in the eyes when her husband was arrested, leaving her and her two boys stunned, alone and unsure of what to do next.  Bitterness began to take hold. Until a friend suggested she focus on “choosing resilience”.  In her new article “How to become resilient, not bitter, when life is challenging”, Diane explains the methods she used to beat bitterness and strengthen her grit and resilience, even amid total life chaos.  Her tips include:  · Seek professional help. Not tomorrow, today. · Find something that you can do to help someone else. · Count your blessings.  Let me know if you’d be interested in seeing the article, speaking with Diane, or checking out a complimentary copy of her book.  - Emily    ______________________  If you would rather not receive future communications from BSPR, please go to https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/wf/click?upn=mAHw-2B8ZZluKmvldupnv96uLo9Y9fajlVzzV3E2AQMMy3o0jRx7vDS35Oho-2BRYwxVM-2F-2BL7LaoyWUUZGT3ACwSPGOnAmMJC-2BvGShXYnXoOxH5mwugzpHk8bzUlL7pdM6V6PGDiF7P8dTVS8BJV5IoVu-2BY769nbQ9u9f6U11s-2BeHbI-3D_6pchHAirW10eM8b14ZAlkZkRllITHdt0G4CIxpgEX-2FYMT-2FVtvkhkoxOwXdc140hQDKip1v9w6NG6f4yMNdzd3I0JbBoOspHl9BOjIgd0xs04I21YFduxE-2B8dkNLBpy8m8CLoOIU6HBz4Afn9ZyMR0Ap2OJvZiNrWVyuZ3V16eAsDadpFrQKryKKqazvt16fUH-2Boq1n-2BT8RE60rJkzIWt4axd1hBMDaHMkmFiUfQuP6-2BUws0zKw9OTAD16C1vo7MQiAbbiS94cMrmte5S0gNDEIDZfVW7lxOWxsfiegW9tFkEA1JYZAnEfgsxVfJcc0SEdLEx9wQSb-2BXvjMqCFQqki3uTKUMYy6q0eXpQpuPRfPk-3D  BSPR, 18 Main Street, Extension, Suite 409, Plymouth, MA 02360 United States  --  To unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to customerservice+unsubscribe@csps.com.",8/7/2019 0:00,,,Junk,,,FALSE,

5000g000028b28WAAQ,"Average Credit Card Debt By State, Revealed","For Immediate Release   ChamberofCommerce.org Publishes Report Detailing Average Credit Card Debt by State   August 6, 2019 – ChamberofCommerce.org has released a report breaking down the average credit card debt that Americans owe by state. Rather than harp on the often-cited national figure of $1 trillion, the report aims to help by focusing on particular states, specific dollar amounts, startling statistics on interest and minimum payments, and revealing correlations regarding the credit card vice that’s currently gripping Americans – some worse than others.  The following are the three states with the highest credit card debt, followed by the three with the lowest.  Highest Average Credit Card Debt Alaska: $10,685      Virginia: $9,120 Texas: $9,100  Lowest Average Credit Card Debt Iowa: $6,726 Wisconsin: $6,737 North Dakota: $7,068  See every state’s average credit card debt, as well as descriptive graphics and analyses: https://www.chamberofcommerce.org/credit-card-debt-by-state  The over-use of credit cards has caused seemingly insignificant minimum payments to take thousands of dollars from unwitting (or financially-helpless) Americans in the form of interest. ChamberofCommerce.org found that individuals in several states are spending an extra $10,000 on their credit card purchases by only paying the minimum each month, something the Federal Reserve confirms is the norm for over 40% of debt-carrying Americans.  ChamberofCommerce.org created this report by compiling and analyzing data from the Federal Reserve (total credit card balances) and the U.S. Census Bureau (median annual household income). Interest payments and other related statistics were calculated separately using the aforementioned data.  # # #   About ChamberofCommerce.org ChamberofCommerce.org is a website dedicated to helping small business owners and entrepreneurs start, market, finance, and grow their businesses. By creating in-depth guides, how-tos, and reviews covering relevant business products, ChamberofCommerce.org hopes to help readers move past the pitfalls that are often to blame for small business failure.

Below is the release, for your ready reference.  Tokyo, 6 August 2019  PRESS RELEASE   Scientists crack the code to improve stress tolerance in plants Novel epigenetic regulation mechanism underlies improved stress response in plants, which can be exploited for global food security  Epigenetic regulation—modification of gene expression from the “outside”—is an important part of the overall genetic processes within a cell. A group of scientists from Tokyo University of Science now reveals a novel epigenetic regulation mechanism that is involved in DNA damage repair in plants, thereby suggesting a possibility of reinforcing global food security.  In any eukaryotic organism, the DNA in a cell exists not as a loose strand, but as a highly condensed complex that consists of DNA and other proteins known as histones. Overall, this condensed structure is referred to as chromatin, and this packaging is important for maintaining the integrity of DNA structure and sequence. However, as chromatin restricts the topology of DNA, modification of chromatin (via modification of histones) is an important form of regulation of genes and is referred to as epigenetic regulation. Now, a group of scientists, led by Prof Sachihiro Matsunaga from Tokyo University of Science, has uncovered a novel epigenetic regulation mechanism, at the center of which lies a histone demethylase enzyme called lysine-specific demethylase 1-like 1 (LDL1). Prof Matsunaga states, “The novel mechanism of epigenetic regulation that we found is related to DNA damage repair in plants, and we believe that it has a lot of real-world applications.” This study is published in Plant Physiology.<http://tx.bz-mail-us1.com/1/l/9c3ec54230704165bd2eff693e8a81fa?rl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.plantphysiol.org%2Fcontent%2Fearly%2F2019%2F07%2F31%2Fpp.19.00530>  An organism’s genome is constantly subjected to various stresses that cause instabilities or errors in it, resulting in damages or “breaks” in the sequences. These breaks are repaired autonomously by a process called homologous recombination (HR), and thus, HR is essential for maintaining the stability of a genome. Like for all other genetic regulatory processes, the chromatin structure needs to be modified for HR to occur smoothly. Prof Matsunaga and team had previously discovered a conserved protein called RAD54; they found that RAD54 is involved in chromatin remodeling in the model plant Arabidopsis and thus aids in genomic stability and response to DNA damage. However, both the recruitment of RAD54 at the site of HR and the proper dissociation of RAD54 from the site are important for it exert its effects. When asked about their motivation for this study, Prof Matsunaga candidly states “Our previous study identified that RAD54 aids HR but the mechanisms of recruitment and dissociation were poorly understood. Our new study attempts to shed light on these mechanisms.”  Using techniques such as co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, the scientists first identified and shortlisted proteins that interact with RAD54 and regulate its dynamics with chromatin during HR-based DNA damage repair in Arabidopsis. They then identified, for the first time, that the histone demethylase LDL1 interacts with RAD54 at DNA damage sites. They found that RAD54 specifically interacts with the methylated 4th lysine amino acid on one of the four core histones in the chromatin, H3 (H3K4me2). The scientists then found that LDL1 suppresses this interaction by demethylating H3K4me2. They concluded that LDL1 removes excess of RAD54 from DNA damage sites via the demethylation of H3K4me2 and thus promotes HR repair in Arabidopsis. Thus, LDL1 ensures proper dissociation of RAD54 from the HR repair site in the DNA.  Hailing this exciting result, Prof Matsunaga says, “This finding is an important addition to plant science as well as basic molecular biology. This is an extension of our previous research that showed that RAD54 accumulated in damaged sites in Arabidopsis and that excessive RAD54 suppresses damage repair, which could be dangerous to the plant. Our new study shows that LDL1 aids and improves DNA damage repair by removing RAD54 from the damaged site.”  So, why are the findings of this study so important? Prof. Matsunaga explains this, too. “Unlike animals, plants are stationary and, therefore, more vulnerable to environmental stresses such as high temperatures, dryness, pathogens, parasites, and poor soil conditions,” says Prof. Matsunaga, “and these stresses suppress the development and growth of plants by causing DNA damage. Therefore, an efficient DNA damage response is crucial to ensure optimum growth and survival of plants. Our study reveals one possible epigenetic regulation mechanism that can improve the DNA damage response in plants.”  Finally, Prof Matsunaga touches upon the most important application of this group’s research. “Plants can be treated with LDL1 to artificially control epigenetic modification so that they become more tolerant to stresses such as infections, environmental stresses and mechanical stress,” says Prof. Matsunaga. “We think that this will be useful in creating resistant varieties of crop plants with improved growth and longevity and better characteristics, thus contributing to global food security.”  Reference  Titles of original paper:  LSD1-LIKE1-mediated H3K4me2 demethylation is required for homologous recombination repair  Journal:  Plant Physiology  DOI:  https://doi.org/10.1104/pp.19.00530  About The Tokyo University of Science Tokyo University of Science (TUS) is a well-known and respected university, and the largest science-specialized private research university in Japan, with four campuses in central Tokyo and its suburbs and in Hokkaido.

If one would take the time to view the evidence of corruption in Salem Oregon and my place at the center of their concern to cover the facts with format complaints, we would begin to see how many poor people are treated when it comes to official business.  In short, the government caters to the rich and leaves the poor people of the United States in virtual debtors prisons all over, my case being a corner stone for the people with common sense to see if one is left in a rural setting and expected to afford for support the state declares in constitutional then why cut the access off by suspending the license of these people  again, no sidewalks, no bus stops, where I live and the only place to find employment the Stock manager just happens to wear a T-Shirt from the Florida Counties Fire Department where I owe child support.  a Florida to Oregon coincidence?  Gregory Reed Sargent 11093 71st ave NE,  Salem,  Oregon USA Civil Action based on being charged 419$ a month with no way to find employment State took license away 17years ago and continiued to charge me 419$ a month till it amounted to 86, 000$  Case in Brief: Natisha Davis and Gregory Sargent got pregnant,  decided on an abortion that Gregory Sargent paid for,  Gregory Sargent returned from work to Natisha Davis doing cocaine stating,  ""I will do the abortion this way."" This is the sworn statement of the record,  this has been repeated several times in court after being arrested for the child support. Gregory Sargent has never seen Gabriel Davis,  the child Natisha Davis attempted to kill with cocaine she purchased with Gregory Sargent's money. Gregory Sargent was so upset after she did cocaine with his money he intended not to ever give any more money to repeat the attempt,  he has never seen Gabriel Davis or Natisha Davis since the abortion,  she did,  her way.   17 years and still fighting on the good moral high ground that Salem, Oregon hasn't found through their unending red-tape that is afforded for.  Fighting a debtors prison in Salem, Oregon, hope you respond to my email about it and I can find relative safety outside of the United States, sadly this country I live in caters to the rich and uses the poor like toys, sexual in many cases, but slaves none the less.  The corner stone of this case is a question anyone should be able to answer,  ""Does a lawyer paid 2000$ an hour and a lawyer paid nothing provide the same defense?""  There are many people that experience this find of poor plight every time they are jailed or hampered in their quest for freedom by restrictions because of the debt they owe.  Good Day.

But then I learned that a child dies about every 11 days when a TV, furniture, or appliance falls on them, and 14,000 children are injured ever year according to CPSC’s newest report (https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/wf/click?upn=G62jSYfZdO-2F12d8lSllQB-2FdNz06aGPPnTbOTf9cWpmpvoAsr6ulsQRPlxY-2BP-2FkFt83h6vgwn5TbwFrG5KszVsC478IzMQjZ0437uSoY055MzVIGCLpUmccaKJKgy2a4JCtQ5vDHE1q5ksOl4LO-2BqoAtPl3GfkecFncq0SPIagrc9l3StRJ0KDbF-2Bz1UK-2FQoo4DhjvIc39BHy3kvdA-2FvsxQ-3D-3D_6pchHAirW10eM8b14ZAlkZkRllITHdt0G4CIxpgEX-2FYMT-2FVtvkhkoxOwXdc140hQDKip1v9w6NG6f4yMNdzd3I0JbBoOspHl9BOjIgd0xs1FQNdS7X0aB5x5Lh0YFCuu52GnqkoyrSCwtzwQV1dnHPLc1lMWkhwo5TZoz1CVCDJhH4y-2FAn3IqeujtcosrWhuA2Y8ljQZnXSDnqbZgBKBu9vyFr5QzEwMZe-2BFVaO1D-2FVI5ORQkmkKbQz7Av0-2BNTfnZCarJEoNzmgf-2BcI2hu8yqtD1ASm5zHRBbngYpdv-2BepttP519E4PqPfZofx9JoTpL2lmg9Ip4aW4YFj3FLnOPY-2F6qpTPHInrjhzrym30peA4-3D . About 70 percent of tip-over fatalities involve children ages 1.5 to 3. These incidents are preventable.    In addition to the new video showing how simple it is to install anti-tip devices (also known as anchors), mothers who have lost a child due to a tip-over incident and CPSC spokespersons are also available for interviews, and would love the chance to educate your audience on the importance of anchoring.

On that note,  I like to read early editions of the Journal, especially the testimonies, to learn how people initially heard about CS. Many women testifiers in the 1890's mentioned hearing about these (alleged)  painless childbirths and naturally wanted to investigate. You might find the  testimony of Mary Simpson from 1912 interesting as her birth experience closely resembles your own. https://journal.christianscience.com/issues/1912/12/30-9/twenty-years-ago-by-a-strange Susan Self  Comment Publication *  I give permission to publish my comment.

5000g000028awhSAAQ,Consumer Alert from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) -- Worshipers targeted by gift card scam,"Dear Colleague,  The Federal Trade Commission<ftc.gov>, the nation's consumer protection agency, is alerting religious leaders around the country about a gift card scam targeting worshipers.  The FTC alert, Worshipers targeted by gift card scam<https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2019/07/worshipers-targeted-gift-card-scam>, explains that scammers pretend to be a pastor, rabbi, priest, imam, or bishop and then ask worshipers for gift card contributions for a worthy cause. Appeals are often made by email, but we've heard people are also getting texts and phone calls, too.  The imposter asks people to buy a popular gift card - frequently, iTunes, Google Play, or Amazon - and then asks for the gift card number and PIN on the back of the card. Those numbers let the scammer immediately get the money people loaded onto the card. And once that's done, the scammer and peoples' money are gone, usually without a trace. But, as outlined in the alert, there are things people should do if they paid a scammer with a gift card<https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/paying-scammers-gift-cards#Paid>.  The FTC would appreciate your help in getting the word out about this scam through your network.  Want to avoid the latest rip-offs? Sign up for free consumer alerts from the FTC at ftc.gov/subscribe<https://www.ftc.gov/stay-connected#_blank>.

Come on, let’s go play!                         WINKY!        Feelin’ mischievous? Or playful? Let’s stir the pot a little!                          GRUMPY!      Grrr! Not feeling it today – goin’ back to bed!                         GOOFY!        Seriously? Let’s do something silly today! Who’s with me?                         HAPPY!        Content as can be. Feelin’ good and full of positive energy.  And to make SMILE! SOX^™ all the more fun, kids and tweens can mix and match SOX by wearing two expressions at the same time! What’s more, since Tween & Women’s size SOX can fit most adult women, Moms can enjoy SMILE! SOX^™ alongside their kids and share a few family smiles together.

SMILE! SOX^™are also ideal gifts to mail to out-of-town family members and friends with kids, to give as get well presents, to surprise your children with during back-to-school time and – in a few short months – to wrap up as holiday presents.  Quite A Feat!                                                                                                                                                              Based in Southern California, SMILE! SOX™ is independently owned and part of the Keepers International family. Founded in 1954, Keepers is a pioneering wholesale distributor of premium-quality, high-fashion socks that began by serving independent apparel and shoe stores along with larger regional department and sporting goods stores located on the West Coast. Today Keepers’ socks are sold in Dress, Casual, and Sport styles for men, women and kids at stores all around the world.    Commenting on the launch of the new SMILE! SOX^™ brand, Paul Hockley, President of Keepers International, said, “For more than 65 years we’ve dressed your feet with fashion, comfort and function but we wanted to do something more – something FUN. That’s where the idea of SMILE! SOX^™ was born. Why not make socks that bring joy to people and inspire happiness?

(https://www.hatcheryla.com/registration-page-6ae50d2f-0ca7-429c-9cba-4b20304a3ba3)  This time I'm sitting down with Nathan Banks, a tech exec for one of the leading software companies in the world.  Listen in as Nathan and I talk over his move away from Christianity and why.  What is it about modern Christianity that completely disinterests so many people, not least of which 30-40 something young professionals, as they take inventory of their core values and what they want for their young and budding families?  As an American living in London and working for one of the most famous tech companies in the world, listen in as he tells the familiar story of why he left fundamental Christianity in his dust for an agnostic and material understanding of life and what's it's all about.  Hear the conversation right from the heart of London's iconic Soho neighborhood as we have friendly and thoughtful dialog on his thoughts on church and why this future-thinking tech exec left it all behind.  Join us as we speak openly, candidly and frankly about some really tough issues that the church must sit with if we have any hope of moving into the future.  Listen as Nathan and I explore in this very unplugged, yet on the record, conversation where nothing is off limits.  Click below to sign up, reserve your spot and get your link.

Product: Monitor Daily  Message: While mourning this weekend’s mass shootings (and all the ones before that make me fear this is a new normal) I read Chapter 20 in Bill Bryson’s book “One Summer: America, 1927” and was surprised to learn our country has experienced random mass killings before (bombings, in that era). The silver lining to me is that they stopped at some point. Which made me realize that we can see a cessation of these mass killings in our generation too. I am curious at what stopped the mass killings then so they were no longer considered inevitable and if there are lessons for us today.

5000g000028asIdAAI,How to Plan an Epic Trip to Hawaii,"""Hawaii is not a state of mind, but a state of grace.""  — Paul Theroux  Aloha! Need help to plan a trip to Hawaii? We just spent an incredible two weeks exploring the best of the Hawaiian islands. The trip wasn’t completely seamless to plan though. Even though you’re traveling to the  There are few destinations in the world that attract quite as many people as Hawaii. This means tourism is big business and there is a multitude of options that at times can feel overwhelming. It doesn’t have to be that way if you have a clear idea of what you want to do and where you want to travel. Here’s how we suggest planning your first trip to Hawaii.  Pick An Island The first step in planning your trip to Hawaii is to know what you want. It’s great to do research on which islands you would like to visit. Each island has its own flavor, landscapes, and experiences. With their own unique selling point choosing the right spot can be pretty difficult. We had two weeks to galavant around and ended up going to the four most popular islands of Hawaii. Here’s an overview of each island and what we thought.  O’ahu – The Gathering Place This is the classic island of Hawaii, its home to Waikiki, Pearl Harbor, the North Shore, Lanikai Beach, and some very infamous hikes. It’s often referred to as the “Heart of Hawaii.” The island packs a punch with a ton of sights, beaches, and hotels. It is also the most popular island and prone to horrendous traffic and waves of tourist. It’s the primary hub in Hawaii with 85% of the state population living here on the island. Daniel K. Inouye International Airport is situated in Honolulu and is the main access point in/out of Hawaii. There is no shortage of hotels and resorts to enjoy while on vacation.  Maui – The Valley Isle One of the most popular Hawaiian Islands and for good reason. Maui has just about everything in a convenient size that means you don’t have to drive for hours like its neighbor, the island of Hawaii. It’s sometimes referred to as the “honeymooner’s island,” and we can attest to that after witnessing four weddings in an afternoon on one small beach. It’s well known for having some fantastic beach resorts, golf courses, the Road to Hana, and Molokini Crater.  Hawai’i – The Big Island This is the youngest and largest island of the Hawaiian Islands, and it’s near twice as big as all the other islands combined.  It should be self-explanatory why Hawaii is better known as the “Big Island.”  It also happens to have the most volcanic activity and is where you will find Hawaii Volcanoes National Park.  An impressive island no doubt with a massive amount of climate zones.  Due to its unique geology, you can find all but four of the world’s climate zones.  It’s truly impressive that one day you can go from black sand beaches to rolling pastures or snow-capped peaks to lush rainforests.  Kaua’i – The Garden Isle Kauai has become more popular in recent years, enough to the point that is was the main island we wanted to visit on our trip to Hawaii.  It’s known for being one the prettiest islands and the most laid back vibe of the four main islands.  The main points of interest are Waimea Canyon, Hanalei Bay, and the Na Pali Coast.  We also found it to be the cheapest of the islands. If you’re in search of beaches Kauai is not known for its beaches, diving, or snorkeling.  Plan Hawaii Trip - Kauai The two other main islands for visitors are Moloka’i dubbed the “friendly isle” and Lana’i dubbed “the pineapple isle.”   Should You Visit More Than One Hawaiian Island? Visiting more than one island is a fantastic idea if you have the time. There are no ferries between the islands which means you have to fly.  Hawaiian Airlines links all of the islands for an affordable price, but the time involved with checking out of your accommodation, arriving at the airport, check-in, flight time, car rental, and then arriving at your next destination can eat up an entire day (we would know we did it four times!) so you should assess your time wisely.  Also, while flights are not expensive $150 on average does eat up a bit of the budget if you do a lot of hopping between islands.  Generally, we would say spend at least three days on each island but recommend even more time to not feel rushed.  When Should You Visit Hawaii? Hawaii is generally very busy. Its reputation and location in the middle of the Pacific draws in visitors from the States, Asia, and Australia. The high season generally runs from the end of November until April, with the peak being the holidays. During this time accommodation, airfare, and rental cars can be extremely high. The draw is the opportunity to escape the cold in the Northern Hemisphere and see humpbacks whales from October to May.  The weather during this time sees more rain and cooler temperatures – granted still very mild. The winter also brings epic surf to the Northern shores attracting pro surfers from around the world, it’s great to see but dangerous for inexperienced swimmers. The next busy period would be the summer months when many take their summer holidays. If you’re looking for shoulder season “deals” look for the months of April, May, September, and October. We almost always recommend September around the world as being the best month for travel and that is still the case with Hawaii. Keep in mind that Hawaii enjoys mild climate and temperatures all year round so there really is no bad time to visit.  If you’re set on the busier periods of time it’s still possible to find some solace and space on the islands, but just requires staying away from the main points of interests and resorts. Kauai in July was quiet away for us when we were away from the resorts. The same goes for Maui and Hawaii. Whereas Oahu is busy year-round with plenty of military personnel and an island of one million people.  Book Your Flight The vast majority of arrivals will be into Honolulu International Airport (HNL) on the island of Oahu. It’s Hawaii’s primary commercial airport and serves domestic carriers along with many international carriers. There are a number of direct flights from the U.S. mainland that still include Oahu, Maui, Kauai, and Hawaii Island. Once you arrive in Hawaii there are no ferries in between the islands so you’ll need to take inter-island flights, which the majority are operated by Hawaiian Airlines.  When we were younger we loved to book the cheapest fare we could find. This often leads to multiple layovers and long days which gets exhausting. Now we like to opt for more direct routes and opt to avoid layovers even is it involves paying a bit more for the convenience. With a large number of direct flight from many US hubs to Hawaii it makes flying more hassle-free. We were stoked to fly with Hawaiian Airlines Honolulu to JFK.  Since it was such a long flight between Honolulu and New York we decided to fly first class for the first time ever and now don’t want to go back. It started off beautifully with lay flat seats and delicious food. The flight attendants were a delight and embodied the “mea ho’okipa” spirit. Mea ho’okipa translates to “I am host” and refers to the warm hospitality given to guests on the Hawaiian Islands. We had a wonderful in-flight experience, including unlimited Mai Tai’s to get us in the mood.  Rent A Car In the early days of Hawaiian tourism it was popular to stay on Waikiki Beach, but as the secrets of the outer islands have become revealed every traveler should spend some time exploring the islands on their own. We’ve often talked about how much we love having a rental car to travel because it allows us to properly explore. For our time in Hawaii, we used Avis across all four islands and had a good experience aside from the location in Oahu where Avis was painfully slow.  We even received two free complimentary upgrades to a convertible Mustang and Jeep Wrangler. These are arguably the two most popular rentals in Hawaii and you will without a doubt see them everywhere. When it comes to rental cars we like to decline insurance because we have primary CDW with our Chase Sapphire Reserve card. Additionally being a member of rewards programs through companies like National or Avis increase your chances of scoring a free upgrade. We’re rarely loyal to one brand of a car company, and find it varies from widely branch to branch – I like to look locally at the branches Google reviews to get a good feel for their service.  Pick up a Guidebook If you’re looking at a short weekend getaway then you probably won’t run out of things to do or places to eat. However, once you spend several days in an area you’ll want to dig a little deeper and explore. One of the best resources we had available was the Hawaiian Airlines Insider’s Guide, written entirely by people who know the islands very well.  The island guides have detailed information on their favorite establishments.  Lonely Planet guidebooks are another accessory we love to pick up when we travel.  They are great for plotting points of interest to each unique traveler. If you want to find the best spots to go snorkel on your own or where to find a poke bowl this is where they can provide great insight. We used these resources to plot points of interest and then planned our days as they come. Or you can check out awesome travel blogs (like ours) to help plan your days.  Plot Your Points of Interest and Activities We are not big fans of planning our days out in advance. Instead, we implement a different strategy of plotting points of interest and having a multitude of options to pick and choose as we please. We like to do this by using a custom Google Maps. It’s pretty simple to do if you have a Google account and the application installed on your smartphone. Simply save the points and add any notes that you see fit. Planning your days as they come avoids the stress of feeling you need to stick to an itinerary and lets you check out saved places based on your location.  Activities in Hawaii When it comes to tours and activities we do recommend booking those in advance. The best tour companies often sell out well in advance, especially in the high season. However, you never know in July we were able to get two spots last minute on a Napali Coast tour, but struck out of luck for Molokini Dive. I would recommend not planning a tour or activity for every day as that will be tiring and leave little room for exploration. You do have to be careful not to overwhelm yourself as there are a ton of enticing activities on the Hawaiian Islands like surf, snorkel, sail, hikes, bikes, zip lines, quads, and food tours.  Consider Adding A Few Days You will never feel like you stayed too long in Hawaii. There is simply too much to do and see. If you can swing it consider adding a few days to your itinerary. It’s too long of a flight to miss out.  Choose Your Hawaiian Accommodation Wisely Accommodation can have one of the largest impacts on your trip so it’s important to get it right. There are a wide range of options and budgets to fill your accommodation needs around Hawaii. Options range from luxury beach resorts to a tent in a public campsite. The location will also have a large impact on the accommodation you choose as you’ll typically find some of the best beaches blocked off by private resorts. We’re big fans of self-catering accommodation and enjoying our time in quieter local areas, but it means we have to drive to popular attractions.  Glamping Hub On the islands of Oahu and Maui, we had the amazing experience to stay at two very unusual properties through Glamping Hub. The first being a bamboo cabin in the nice community of Haiku on the island of Maui. It was so relaxing and our place had a full kitchen, living area, and a private hot tub. Mornings were spent sipping Kona coffee and listening to the birds far away from the distractions of resorts. On the island of Oahu, we spent our time in a yurt with Ohana Yurts near Haleiwa. We loved chatting with Jenny and Nathan about their yurt project – check out their TV show! With properties like these, you have a much more personalized experience that you won’t find at hotels or resorts.  Self Catering You have a lot of options to stay in self-catering in Hawaii. Booking these through the various sharing economy sites like Glamping Hub or Airbnb is easy!. Or you can seek out resort style self-catering options like Waimea Plantation Cottages on Kauai. That is where we stayed on the Garden Isle and had a fantastic time in their refurbished cabins in the small town of Waimea. Self-catering options allow for more privacy away from the big resorts and allow you to cook your own meals. Food costs in Hawaii are high so the ability to cook your own meals can save you a lot of money.  Resorts If you’re looking to relax in the lap of luxury and sip mai tais by the pool there are plenty of resorts on the Hawaiian Islands to enjoy. The majority of resorts are built in certain neighborhoods together and offer direct access to a semi-private beach – you can’t own the beach but the land around the beach. These resort communities are built so guests never have to leave with golf courses, shopping malls, coffee shops, movie theatres,  and chain restaurants. On the island of Hawaii, we stayed at the Hilton Waikoloa a massive resorts with multiple restaurants, pools, waterslides, and activities. If you’re interested in staying at a beach resort Maui is most known for its resorts with the Four Seasons, Grand Waimea, Sheraton, and Westin.  Hotels There are plenty of traditional hotels in Waikiki and scattered throughout all the islands. You won’t find many of the standard big chain hotels like Comfort Inn, Holiday Inn, DoubleTrees, or Residence Inns. Instead there are a number of smaller boutique and independent hotels around the islands of Maui, Hawaii, and Kauai.  Camping With an amazing amount of beautiful landscapes, hiking trails, beaches, state parks, and even national forests there are plenty of places camp. Most sites require prior reservations and planning in advanced. I suggest having a good idea of where you intend to camp before heading to Hawaii. You will need a car to embark on a camping adventure. Trucks are a good option for families who need lots of space for supplies.  ============================================================ Our mailing address is: Obra Hawaii Delights Street 5, Shop 22 Near Market Melbourne, Hw 74200 Australia  Want to change how you receive these emails?

5000g000028bYmWAAU,"CHANGEMAKERS: The Industrious Future of the Digital Economy, by Adam Arvidsson","Publishing November 3, 2019   ** ------------------------------------------------------------  This book argues that, as industrial capitalism enters a period of prolonged crisis, a new paradigm of ‘industrious modernity’ is emerging. Based on small-scale, commons-based and market-oriented entrepreneurship, this industrious modernity is being pioneered by the many outcasts that no longer find a place within a crumbling industrial modernity.  These outcasts are both popular in origin and from the middle class. Some are drawn from the many migrants that arrive in the booming megacities in emerging economiesas well as in the metropolises of the developed economies. Others are knowledgeworkers who, despite a university education, are unable to find, or do not desire, acareer in the corporate world; instead they are forced to go freelance, or choose to starta small business of their own. In its popular as well as in its middle class version this new industriousness draws on the new planetary commons that have been generated by the globalization of industrial capitalism itself. The outsourcing of material production to global supply chains have made the skills necessary to engage in commodity production generic and common, and the globalization of media culture and the internet have generated new knowledge commons. Together these new commons have radically reduced the capital requirements to engage in economic activity, and are providing new highly efficient tools of productive organization at little cost. Rather than challenging capitalism head-on, Arvidsson argues that this new industrious modernity is likely to develop gradually, as a progressively more attractive alternative to an industrial capitalism in terminal decline.  This timely analysis of the new forces of change in our societies today will be of great interest to students and scholars in sociology, politics and media and cultural studies as well as to anyone concerned with the impact of digital technologies and the future of capitalism.
