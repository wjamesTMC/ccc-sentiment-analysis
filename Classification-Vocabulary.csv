I know she loved Mary Baker Eddy and Christian Science, and I am grateful for all it has done for Mom over the last 65 years.  She did not give me here membership number, so if you need that information, then please let me know, and I will look for it.  My mother's name is Evelyn Cline from Carefree, Arizona, and was formerly of Tucson, AZ.

I don't know how this mistake regarding my contribution happened or why my AMEX card was only charged for the first time in August.  I want to honor my initial intention of contributing $3025 for 2019.  Please let me know how I can reach my total contribution goal for 2019 without having to make a lump sum payment.

There were no errors in the text of the lesson about which the printer would have to be consulted. The error was in the assembling of the (correctly) printed pages. In several issues, the pages 5 to 12 were contained twice (subject: Love), and the pages 13 to 20 were missing. Correspondingly, the connected pages 61 to 68 (subject: Mind) appeared twice, while the pages 53 to 60 were missing. -- We will offer copies of the missing pages taken from correct issues and deliver them to our customers who received the faulty issues, so we do not need extra copies. So this is just to inform you about what exactly happened, and hopeful to avoid a future repetition of the mistake. Thank you for your help, and all the best wishes for your precious work!

But, I do not feel that your article on vaccines was in line with the Spirit of your magazine.  Basically, Christian Scientists would not be taking vaccines and would not feel that a paper published by the church, which is supposed to be fair, would publish an article in which the dominant position was that people that don't take vaccines are all mistrustful or anti-government or big Pharma.  Basically, I think in an article lke that, it would be helpful to clearly express the position of the church and then fairly epresent both sides of the issue.  In the article, you did not quote one person that has refused to give vaccines to their child for religious or other reasons.  You only quote people who are totally supportive of vaccines or who are supportive enough to have given their child vaccines.  I find this sloppy journalism and it represents sloppy thinking.  Something that the Monitor is not known for at all and something that is not reflected in the rest of the issue.  Thank you fr taking my comment!

I understand your desire to charge for Monitor articles online, and I appreciate that a previous bug was fixed which had caused the same article to count as multiple articles if I opened it from my email, then tried to read it in a browser.  And, it’s nice that you include links to the CS Perspective articles from JSH.  However there is nothing to indicate that opening those links will cause an article to be charged to the now three a month allowed as a guest.  Please add a warning with the links on the JSH page that lets people know these articles count towards the three free a month.  Failing to do so implies the articles are free with a JSH subscription, as are all the other articles that have links in JSH.

5000g000028c5GJAAY,Glamping Cover Story -- disappointing,"On the heels of the UN Climate report last week, it was very disappointing to receive the most recent Monitor with a cover story about ""Glamping"".  A cover story about the efforts of the Trump Administration to dismantle longstanding environmental safeguards (the Endangered Species Act, for example) would have been far more relevant and edifying to Monitor readers.  Why prominently perpetuate the myth that humans can easily insulate themselves from the natural world and that doing so is a good thing?  The Monitor needs to be far more direct about its climate reporting.  This global threat needs immediate and decisive action and prayer.  Widespread complacency needs to be disrupted -- the facts need to be widely broadcast.  The Monitor -- with its base of engaged readers -- is in a perfect position to do this.  To tread lightly on the subject of climate change because here in the U.S. powerful corporate and political interests have created the *fiction *that there is some uncertainty about whether climate change is real only serves to validate those who are committed to perpetuating ignorance about this issue.  Why not feature a cover story about Greta Thunberg and *devote an entire issue* to climate change this fall, in advance of the Global Climate Strike on September 20th?  See https://globalclimatestrike.net/ and https://www.brightest.io/cause/fridays-for-future/activity/global-climate-strike-september-20/  *Sharon C.

But, I do not feel that your article on vaccines was in line with the Spirit of your magazine.  Basically, Christian Scientists would not be taking vaccines and would not feel that a paper published by the church, which is supposed to be fair, would publish an article in which the dominant position was that people that don't take vaccines are all mistrustful or anti-government or big Pharma.  Basically, I think in an article lke that, it would be helpful to clearly express the position of the church and then fairly epresent both sides of the issue.  In the article, you did not quote one person that has refused to give vaccines to their child for religious or other reasons.  You only quote people who are totally supportive of vaccines or who are supportive enough to have given their child vaccines.  I find this sloppy journalism and it represents sloppy thinking.  Something that the Monitor is not known for at all and something that is not reflected in the rest of the issue.  Thank you fr taking my comment!

I know the full 7% doesn’t go to illegal aliens, but think about what a portion of this amount could do to support our legal citizens if it was directed to those that need these benefit programs.  But that perception is not based on the facts. Let’s take food stamps: 93% of all food stamp payments go to native-born U.S. citizens<https://www.csmonitor.com/Photo-Galleries/Infographics/10-Immigration-myths-debunked/(photo)/739915>. What about Medicaid? The Associated Press puts that number at 93%.  Keep up the good reporting. I love the Monitor.

Officials framed the decision as a principled push toward self-reliance.  True compassion isn’t giving someone a fish; it’s teaching them how to fish. In other words, tighter green card rules help people become self-sufficient, administration officials suggest. Of course, tackling the problem of “freeloading” immigrants plays well with voters as we head into the 2020 election.  But that perception is not based on the facts.

Immigrants are almost twice as likely to become entrepreneurs as native-born U.S. citizens<https://hbr.org/2016/10/why-are-immigrants-more-entrepreneurial>, reports Harvard Business Review. Immigrants make up just 13% of the population but account for nearly 28% of America’s entrepreneurs. To become a U.S. citizen, immigrants need to be resourceful, persistent, and determined in overcoming obstacles – the same qualities that make good entrepreneurs.  Just ask South African immigrant Elon Musk (Tesla), Russian immigrant Sergey Brin (Google), or Taiwanese immigrant Jerry Yang (Yahoo).  ~ [https://images.csmonitor.com/csm/2017/06/1029905_4_illustration-Dave_Scott_standard.png?alias=square_400x400] <https://click.cssubs.com/?qs=9a53d677a603140d2d1c2ec284feb553a652ef254ff6c401ac232f2631c32fb5faa8e7dffd409ee2f8d1b36e66d63b50503b5913555f75aba2595511e1806754>  David Clark Scott  Audience Engagement Editor  [twitter] @davidclarkscott <https://twitter.com/davidclarkscott?cmpid=ema:bundle:20190813&src=email>  [Daily facebook share] <https://click.cssubs.com/?qs=9a53d677a603140dcfa2ebbe33b2d4e483240d8e29a4734ec12538238f3e4348aeaf160a7af1f3f28f596d721f8c2869d31552aa2e0a0416f43ee661cdec8a90> [Daily twitter share]  <https://click.cssubs.com/?qs=9a53d677a603140d1bc63129acabb9050545c209c7593f8d4d57a4e9323b94f34606e5801bd639fb981e84e16baf5c3a74fff4f524d9fd224cbc98daf43c559a> [Daily email share]  <mailto:?subject=I+think+you%27ll+like+this+article+from+the+Monitor+Daily&body=Here's%20the%20article%20on%20CSMonitor.com:+%0A%0A+Are%20immigrants%20really%20freeloaders?+%0A%0A+https://www.csmonitor.com/Daily/2019/20190813/Are-immigrants-really-freeloaders?src=shared+%0A%0A+You%20can%20try%20the%20Monitor%20Daily%20free%20for%20a%20week:%20https://www.csmonitor.com/dailyfreetrial> 1.

Our reporter looks at the big role this small, rural state plays in America’s democracy, and in choosing the nation’s next leader.  – David  The 30 Sec. Read  Over the course of 10 days this month, more than a million people will come to the Iowa State Fair to sample pork chops on a stick, ride the Ferris wheel, and gawk at the famous “butter cow.” Many will also encounter various Democratic presidential candidates, making their pitch from a soapbox.  “You have a big burden on your shoulders,” Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar tells the crowd.  For nearly 50 years, Iowa has played an outsize role in the presidential nomination process, with its first-in-the-nation caucuses. And while the state has a mixed track record when it comes to selecting presidents, it plays a pivotal role in winnowing the field. On the Democratic side, seven of the past nine winners in Iowa have gone on to secure their party’s nomination.  Iowa’s voters are known for taking their role seriously. But it is one of the whitest states in the nation, which has led to questions about its influence. Those may only grow this cycle, when with less than a year to go until the national Democratic convention, there are still some two dozen candidates in the running.  “The bigger the field, the more important the caucus is,” says Dennis Goldford, a political scientist at Drake University in Des Moines.

Our reporter looks at an effort to foster leadership qualities to combat secular intellectualism and corruption.  – David  The 30 Sec. Read  India’s Hindu nationalist movement is taking the next steps in building a new generation of leaders – especially among educated, urban youth.  In creating new higher education programs, it’s drawing upon the popularity of India’s first Hindu nationalist prime minister, Narendra Modi. He surprised almost everyone with a convincing reelection victory in national elections in June. At the same time, his ruling party reinforced its hold on parliament. It’s that kind of political dominance that emboldened Mr. Modi this month to revoke the Indian Constitution’s article granting special autonomous status to majority-Muslim Kashmir.  Mr. Modi has not only boosted the image of the nationalist movement but has also been central to the movement’s growth among a key segment of the population. “You could map the growing interest of educated youngsters, doctors and entrepreneurs and professionals, in entering politics and improving governance to the rise of Narendra Modi,” says Ravindra Sathe, dean of the recently established Indian Institute of Democratic Leadership.

But our reporter found it is also a place of burgeoning hope, where at least some innovative people are treating the crisis as an opportunity.  – David  The 30 Sec. Read  With the front lines now just about seven miles from the city limits, the ongoing war in eastern Ukraine is seldom far from the subject of any conversation in the port city of Mariupol. But recently, the battleground has become ideological too. More than half of voters in the Ukrainian-controlled Donetsk region cast their ballots for two pro-Russian parties who blame Kiev, not next-door Russia, for their troubles. These divisions are a huge challenge for new President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, whose party came in second in July elections around here.  The challenges facing the city are on full display at Mariupol’s Azov Sea port, which a decade ago shipped more than 15 million tons annually of products to every corner of the world. But the establishment of two separatist republics took much of the port’s hinterland away. The loss of the nearby Russian market amid an ongoing sanctions war between Ukraine and Russia inflicted more damage.  “We all hope that with the new leadership at the top of the country, this war will end,” says Yuri Balan, deputy director of the port. “Peace is the main thing that everyone here in the Donbass wants.”  [https://images.csmonitor.com/csm/2019/08/1087989_3_0813-mariupol_map_large.jpg?alias=original] <https://www.csmonitor.com/Daily/2019/20190813?cmpid=ema:bundle:20190813&src=email#1093944> Karen Norris/Staff  By Fred Weir  Read 6 min.<https://www.csmonitor.com/Daily/2019/20190813?cmpid=ema:bundle:20190813&src=email&id=1093944>  ( 1251 words )  [Daily facebook share]<https://click.cssubs.com/?qs=9a53d677a603140d44eee0be4fc7141fdbc3db167da950a5a6985e9568fefa20298f5b0ae9c6b19241b9fb173335a51e4b814c1aec050262b146e13168705f94> [Daily twitter share] <https://click.cssubs.com/?qs=9a53d677a603140d859bcb9e877062d2879ac8a86579752c68386fdf9018dc838f512cdf7c70c7eab0ad2fade82a198497764db05360ead87591823e1501442a>  [Daily email share] <mailto:?subject=I+think+you%27ll+like+this+article+from+the+Monitor+Daily&body=Here's%20the%20article%20on%20CSMonitor.com:+%0A%0A+Isolated%20by%20Ukraine’s%20war,%20this%20city%20looks%20for%20a%20peaceful%20future+%0A%0A+https://www.csmonitor.com/Daily/2019/20190813/Isolated-by-Ukraine-s-war-this-city-looks-for-a-peaceful-future?src=shared+%0A%0A+You%20can%20try%20the%20Monitor%20Daily%20free%20for%20a%20week:%20https://www.csmonitor.com/dailyfreetrial> 4.

But scores of Mainers are rejecting a scarcity mindset as their city welcomes hundreds of asylum-seekers.  – David  The 30 Sec. Read  On a recent afternoon, volunteers cooked 600 meals to be served at a local sports arena. Lined with cots instead of bleachers, the Portland Expo Center became an emergency shelter in June with the sudden arrival of Central African asylum-seekers. Several meal prep volunteers are asylum-seekers themselves. They slip in and out of French, Portuguese, and Lingala with the ease of changing aprons. Some have already found temporary housing. Yet day after day, they keep turning up to cook for fellow newcomers.  “My people,” a volunteer named Nathalie calls them. “As they eat and feel fed, I also feel better.”  Portland has gained at least 437 asylum-seekers in less than two months. Their arrival cued another surge: an outpouring of donations and volunteerism. Immigrant community leaders, who once sought fresh starts here themselves, have bridged resource gaps between the newcomers and the public’s generosity.  Maine resident Jeff Diggins has hosted three families in the past. A fiscal conservative from Texas, he acknowledges the complexity of the U.S. immigration system and values that asylum-seekers are in the country legally.  “I don’t think kindness is a limited resource,” says Mr. Diggins.

Five hundred years after Leonardo da Vinci’s death, we examine the paths he took to endless creativity.  – David  The 30 Sec. Read  Two things consistently fascinated Leonardo da Vinci: the mechanics of flight and the movement of water. His mind was like both, swiftly flowing but occasionally pooling to encompass depths beneath the surface.  At the 500th anniversary of his death, scholars, art lovers, and the public are taking a far-reaching look at his career. Exhibitions in Italy and England, as well as the largest-ever survey of his work, which opens at the Louvre Museum in Paris this fall, are celebrating the master’s achievements not only in art but also in science.  One of those exhibitions, of Leonardo’s drawings, is attracting multitudes to the Queen’s Gallery at Buckingham Palace in London. “Leonardo da Vinci: A Life in Drawing” displays the full range of Leonardo’s elastic mind at work. It conveys a life in process, a man and mind on a continuous learning curve, endlessly observing, studying, thinking, reflecting. The drawings – more than the finished paintings – show him improvising and experimenting, much more than just recording reality.

The 30 Sec. Read  Since 2006, the world has witnessed a decline in political rights and civil liberties. Yet 13 years on, this troubling trend could be in reverse. From Algeria to Slovakia, young people have taken to the streets to push for a range of democratic ideals. The most unexpected protests have been in Russia and in China’s semiautonomous territory of Hong Kong.  In particular, the protests in those two giants of autocracy indicate there is a limit to how much people will tolerate a loss of basic freedoms and the right to self-governance. They also show a strong memory of what happened 30 years ago when Beijing brutally ended pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square and the popular uprisings in Eastern Europe led to the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Soviet empire.  China may yet crush the Hong Kong protests, while in Russia, President Vladimir Putin wields a strong stick. But at least the signal has been sent that democracy’s decline is not inevitable.

Those terms have been sorely missing in our periodicals in recent years. In Article XXII, Section 1 in our Church Manual, Mrs. Eddy speaks of calling her “Leader” and says that Leader is “already used in our periodicals”, but it is not being used in our periodicals of late. She is often referred to as “Discoverer” and/or “Founder”, but seldom “Leader”. It is important that she be recognized and acknowledged as our Leader. She is our forever Leader and that should be made clear in our periodicals. Many of the testimonies in the chapter Fruitage in Science and Health refer to our “revered Leader”, our “beloved Leader”, our “dear Leader”, our “faithful Leader"" and this is done even more than once in a single testimony on occasion. Why is it that the expression of our gratitude for our Leader, for her Leadership, is so lost? Please, bring it back!

5000g000028cNbIAAU,Re: Why El Paso is determined not to roll up the welcome mat,"Dear Mark,     Earlier this week I came across the following quotation by Maria Nemeth, in her 1999 book The Energy of Money: ""We all exist in an interdependent system.  No matter how we feel about it, we're linked socially, economically, and biologically, like the cells of a giant organism.  We are healthiest when all parts of our bodies and society are functioning together."" -p. 271 Five sentences later, at the end of the next paragraph, Nemeth concludes: ""Given that interdependence, it quickly becomes clear that our greatest success comes when all of us succeed together."" -p. 271     It is clear, both that former president Obama understood this concept, and also that current president Trump does not.  This concept is also the correct answer to white nationalists here in the U.S.A. and also to the nationalist movement in the U.K.     One of the headlines in today's news is that five countries outside the U.S.A. are ""teetering on the brink of recession:""  China, German, Italy, U.K., and Japan.  It is clear from Nemeth's words that if China goes into recession, then every country in the world will be adversely affected--including the U.S.A.     I would like to request that you use the Christian Science Monitor as a ""bully pulpit,"" so to speak, to publicize Nemeth's words.  Because we the people need to disassemble the current trade wars as soon as possible, or a lot of people are going to suffer badly if we don't.

Today, our five handpicked stories start with an extraordinarily beautiful portrait of the grace of El Paso. We also pull back the curtain on the U.S.-China economic battle, look at how President Donald Trump’s approach to foreign policy is changing the Middle East, examine why independent bookstores endure, and tell the story of one family’s amazing dedication to save a rare horse breed.  But first a look at why the world should be watching Hong Kong.  These days, it would seem, authoritarianism is on the march. From Russia to the Philippines to Saudi Arabia, strongmen seem to be calling the shots. Elsewhere, strains of populism have some worried that democratic norms are under threat or already in tatters.  But in Hong Kong, protesters have put the strongest of strongmen – Chinese President Xi Jinping – in a bind. The demonstrators are increasingly worried that the Hong Kong they love is vanishing. The rights and liberties that have made the city a unique and flourishing hub of culture and global trade seem to be hanging in the balance. So The Wall Street Journal notes that protesters are becoming more desperate and radical in their determination to fight for their way of life.  It is a reminder that freedoms, once spread, are hard to take away. To be sure, mainland China holds the upper hand. But Hong Kong – and Taiwan – show that freedom and justice put down tenacious roots. For decades after World War II, the world took flawed but unprecedented steps to spread and protect freedoms across the globe. Hong Kong shows that such seeds can be transformative.  ~   |      |      | |   Mark Sappenfield    Editor      @sappenfieldm     |      |            |       |   |  |  |   |    |       |    1. Why El Paso is determined not to roll up the welcome mat    |     |       Callaghan O'Hare/Reuters    |       |    El Paso is an old city with a big heart, residents told our reporter. Its embrace of all isn’t going anywhere, they say, despite a terrorist attack aimed at its diversity.    |      |   – Mark    |       |  The 30 Sec. Read  | |    As the sun set over El Paso, Texas, dozens of people gather outside the Immaculate Baptist Church for a vigil for the 22 people who died in an attack at a Walmart. Pastor J.C. Rico leads prayers in both English and Spanish.  “I refuse to let that change the way we live, change the way we are,” says Rosie Rico, the pastor’s wife.  The alleged gunman had no ties to this 400-year-old city on the banks of the Rio Grande. He drove more than 600 miles from a Dallas suburb to commit the attack, which law enforcement are treating as domestic terrorism. El Paso has been, for years now, statistically one of the safest cities in the country – but now some residents are questioning whether they are safe from the rest of America.  “It’s like we’re the antithesis of how a lot of people in the heartland, where I grew up, view us,” says Bill Clark, co-owner of the bookstore Literarity. “It’s probably the most welcoming city one could want to live in.”  Daniel Aguilar, who attended the vigil, says, “It sounds like [the gunman] was not getting love. He would have got love from us. We would have given him love.”    | |   By Henry Gass    | |    @henrygass    | |  Read 7 min.  | |   ( 1648 words )    | |       |       |    2. Currency manipulator? What latest twist in trade war means.    |     |       Chinatopix/AP    |       |    The recent stock market jolt underlines the complex consequences of trade wars and currency manipulation. This story explains the thinking behind the deeper chess battle between the U.S. and China.    |      |   – Mark    |       |  The 30 Sec. Read  | |    Fears of a currency war have piled atop anxiety about rising tariffs and their toll on the global economy.  Stock markets around the world swooned after Beijing allowed its currency to fall below a key level against the U.S. dollar. The United States declared China a currency manipulator. Meanwhile, the U.S. and other nations have shifted toward lowering interest rates – a move that can often result in weakening currencies.  But is this a currency war, a modern version of what happened during the Great Depression when nations devalued their currency in a vain attempt to boost their exports at the expense of others?  Many economists are skeptical. The big risk to global economic growth, they say, isn’t currency but tariffs – with the U.S. threats escalating against China last week. And the interest rate cuts can be explained as addressing that risk to overall growth, not as currency manipulation.  Pushing currency values lower can also blunt the impact of tariffs. Battles over currency “are not that bad,” says Olivier Jeanne, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. But as a tool in a rising trade war, it’s worrying.    | |   By Laurent Belsie    | |    @lbelsie    | |  Read 5 min.  | |   ( 1069 words )    | |       |       |    3. Checkbook diplomacy? How Qatar’s renewed US ties reshape the Gulf.    |     |      |       |    Shared values? Or shared interests? The principle guiding President Trump’s “transactional” diplomacy has been more the latter. Among Gulf Arabs, that’s created competition for good U.S. relations.    |      |   – Mark    |       |  The 30 Sec. Read  | |    President Donald Trump’s about-face on Qatar – receiving the emir, Sheikh Tamim al-Thani, at the White House in July as an “old friend” two years after condemning the Gulf Arab state as a “funder of terrorism” – was telling.  It potentially shifted the balance of power in the Gulf, opening a door to a resurgence of multilateralism in the region. And, say observers and officials there, it exposed the limits of influence achieved by Qatar’s rivals, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, in a transactional White House.  Just as Mr. Trump touted Saudi Arabia’s billions in arms deals during a March 2018 visit by the crown prince, in the recent visit by the emir, Qatar inked tens of billions of dollars in deals with Raytheon, Boeing, and Chevron. It was a case of Qatar beating Saudi Arabia and the UAE at their own game.  Says Andreas Krieg, a lecturer in security studies at King’s College London: “The Qataris understood that Trump is very much a transactional president – as much as the Saudis and the UAE understand – you need to pour money into the country in order to win his favor.”    | |   By Taylor Luck    | |  Read 5 min.  | |   ( 1195 words )    | |       |       |  Point of Progress  What's going right   | |    4. Comeback story: A new chapter for indie bookstores    |     |      |       |    While their numbers aren’t what they once were, independent bookstores are reclaiming their place in society. Behind their surprise resurgence is renewed emphasis on fostering community.     |      |   – Mark    |       |  The 30 Sec. Read  | |    In the past decade, the number of independent bookstores in the United States has grown by more than 50%, from 1,651 stores to more than 2,500, according to Dan Cullen, senior strategy officer of the American Booksellers Association.   Observers say a special blend of local flavor, dedication to physical books, accessibility to authors, and a business model that includes other revenue streams has fueled the resurgence. The formula has proved so successful chains are working to bring a small-venue feel to their big-box stores.   “One of the key ingredients to the independent bookseller is this notion of community,” says Ryan Raffaelli, an assistant professor at Harvard Business School. Owners often sit on city boards and are active in public schools, he says.   Patricia Fowler, owner of Village Square Booksellers in Bellows Falls, Vermont, serves as treasurer for two local community groups and participated in a program to support high schoolers as they plan for the future.   “Some of our customers that started out reading picture books are now into the teen and young adult books,” says Ms. Fowler. “We grow with our customers.”    | |   By Thomas Shults    | |  Read 3 min.  | |   ( 649 words )    | |       |       |  Difference-maker  Drivers of change   | |    5.

Read  | |    With its wild ’80s-rock-star mane, muscular body, and charismatic nature, the Skyrian horse has become a sort of cultural icon for the Greek island of Skíros. But today, there are fewer than 300 of these horses left worldwide, maybe 200 if counting only purebreds.  Stathis Katsarelias was drawn to the breed and its cultural significance. “I felt this duty because I’m from Skíros,” he says. “As a Skyrian, we should care about them.”  “They will grab your soul and your heart,” says his partner, Amanda Simpson.  In 2005, Ms. Simpson and Mr. Katsarelias started Skyros Island Horse Trust. From the beginning, its mission was twofold: take care of the existing population on Skíros and selectively breed the horse to create a more robust breed. When they started the project, they took in horses from locals who could no longer care for them, as well as some starving horses wandering on the mountainside. They started with four horses. Today, there are 35.  “When I see them here, and I understand that they feel safe, and that they feel secure, and that they are relaxed, this gives me the strength to go on,” says Mr. Katsarelias.    | |   By Becky Holladay    | |  Read 5 min.  | |   ( 1155 words )    | |       |       |  The Monitor's View     | |    In Dayton and El Paso, the potential power of forgiveness    |     |  The 30 Sec. Read  | |    Police are still trying to pin down the exact motives for last weekend’s killings in two American cities. But one motive fits both. Each dehumanized their victims out of rage. Yet not surprisingly, a few of the victims’ families as well as community leaders have refused to reciprocate the rage. They have offered forgiveness.  Acts of forgiveness after a massacre are rare. Yet they can be powerful. In a reminder of what is possible, a documentary came out this spring that details the forgiveness given to Dylan Roof by families of victims killed in 2015 at a black church in Charleston, South Carolina. In the new film “Emanuel,” Chris Singleton, the son of one victim in the church, says his forgiveness was not a choice to “move on.” It took strength to forgive. And it allowed him to be free of anger, to spread love and unity, and to work to prevent similar tragedies.  The impersonal hate of the shooters in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, deserves a response at many levels – justice in the courts, reforms in legislatures, and denunciation of their motives. Yet none may be as powerful to prevent more shootings than forgiveness.    | |   By the Monitor's Editorial Board    | |  Read 3 min.  | |   ( 603 words )    | |       |       |  A Christian Science Perspective  ( About this feature )   | |    Listening for the voice of Love, not hate    |     |    It’s not always easy to let love lead us forward instead of hate, especially in the wake of tragic events.

Her skills were even put to use when she scored a catcher's position on a men's team in Vilsek Germany where she lived with her military husband.  Now 24 years old, a wife and a mother of 2, she says these were some of the best times she ever had.  Girls rule!",8/12/2019 0:00,CSM,Content,Feedback - Positive,,,FALSE

5000g000028bwCbAAI,Angels,"Attn: Tony Lobl  I missed the podcast on angels but will find it!  This isn’t for publication as it probably wouldn’t be suitable. But I have to share my experience with you.  I’m a lifetime Christian Scientist, having been raised in an active Christian Science home where it was practiced on a daily basis. I was always taught from the Bible and Science and Health, by Mary Baker Eddy that angels were God talking to us through our own thoughts. Not winged creatures with halos, etc.  I’ve come many years from those lessons but never stopped trusting in them.       A month ago my husband and I were looking for our passports to renew them.  We live on the third level, garage/basement to main floor and the bedrooms.  Searching for 3 consecutive days in every conceivable place; file cabinets, desks, computer cabinets, bedroom closets and drawers, car and van, without success. We were at a total loss as to their location.  I threw up my hands and said, “I’m turning this over to God, He knows everything! I should have done this 3 days ago!”  Day 4 I was folding laundry in the upstairs bedroom, when loudly, firmly a voice said “Go to the Van”!  I dropped everything, went down the 4 levels of stairs, opened the door to the garage, opened the van door, passenger side, got in, opened the cabinet between the seats, reached in, removed 2 passports, without the blink of an eye!  I sat there totally amazed, raised my head to praise God and said out loud....”Dear angel if you had a name I would say Thank You to you and God!”      I would swear I heard “Hazel”. I smiled, said “thank you Hazel, angel messenger of God!”   I ran upstairs, shared the “lost that was found” with my astonished husband, and called a dear Christian Science friend.  Half an hour later she called back saying she checked her Hebrew Dictionary to see if Hazel might be listed.  It was and was defined as “GOD SEES”!  Since then I can attest for sure that God’s messages are strong, to be listened to and obeyed. No matter a name or not!     I so enjoy your Sentinel Watch and wanted to share this with you Tony! Sincerely, Ellen C Allen  Celebrate What’s Right With The  World??",8/13/2019 0:00,JSH,Sentinel,Feedback - Positive,,,FALSE

The Indian government’s decision last week to revoke Jammu and Kashmir’s special status, enshrined in the constitution, which granted some autonomy to the country’s only Muslim-majority state.

Cory Booker calls for “courageous empathy.” Joe Biden praises consensus building. Yet those two find it hard to practice what they preach. Each have thrown ad hominem barbs at the other. They both undercut their most strategic message as a leader: cooperation. Neither candidate has totally abandoned his olive-branch rhetoric, but as they eye the polls, both use it selectively. >  > In his 2016 book “Toward Democracy,” historian James T. Kloppenberg traces the roots of modern self-government to qualities of love, such as deliberation, reciprocity, and plurality. Citizens in a democracy must resolve conflicts peacefully, accept differences in policy and identity, and expect the same in return. Crucial to these attributes of self-governance is a selfless love summed up in the golden rule. >  > Messrs. Booker and Biden need not look back in history to find a persuasive case for political love. They’ve both made the case in recent years.

I had graduated from college with no job prospects, so I returned to a previously held sales job. Every evening it was my job to vacuum the sales floor. Initially this  task seemed to depress me and caused me to wonder why I had gone to university. But after awhile I started to pray about my situation. As I vacuumed I would ponder the words to Me Eddy's hymn, ""Satisfied"", it matters not what be they lot so Love doth guide. Shortly after that point, I realized that I had loved my way out of that job into a position in line with my studies. Thx for reminding me and thanks for sharing your experience on Sentinel Watch.

But first, a look at perseverance and adaptation.  Thursday’s report <https://www.ipcc.ch/report/srccl/> from the U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change did more than lay out the sobering scope of desertification and land degradation and the implications for feeding the world. It also hinted at hope.  “The good news is [that] there’s ample room for mitigation,” Michael Mann, a professor of atmospheric science at Penn State, told CNN <https://www.cnn.com/videos/world/2019/08/09/amanpour-michael-mann-ipcc-climate-crisis.cnn>. One key piece, he and others say: coaxing more productivity from land. Technological innovation will help <https://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/the-monitors-view/2019/0808/Climate-gloom-and-innovation-bloom>. Both consumer and land-use practices will need to shift worldwide. What about local action?  Last fall, the Camp fire burned more than 153,000 acres in Northern California and erased the town of Paradise (most of its population remains displaced <https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/07/11/paradise-california-population-camp-fire-california-wildfire-fund/1710525001/>). But as Martin Kuz reported in May <https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Society/2019/0403/After-California-wildfires-what-survivors-say-they-gained-from-loss>, some residents emerged with renewed purpose.  And more recently, ecosystem restoration there has become hands-on. In pockets, reports Yes! Magazine <https://www.yesmagazine.org/planet/california-wildfire-survivors-recovery-permaculture-20190723>, residents are trying permaculture. In its fullest form that’s an approach where native crops and animals are positioned to help one another thrive – think nut trees surrounded by farmed pigs. The self-sustaining, soil-enriching cycle that results can dramatically boost per-acre yields <https://charleseisenstein.org/essays/permaculture-and-the-myth-of-scarcity/> .  “Welcome to the experiment!” Matthew Trumm, founder of the Camp Fire Restoration Project, tells those who have turned up to help. (His own work was inspired by an agronomist’s mid-1990s project in China.)  Already taking root in parts of Paradise: a constructive outlook to pass along.  “Because you’re bringing the next generation [into] thinking about this stuff,” said Mr. Trumm, “you’re healing that next generation.” ~ [image: https://images.csmonitor.com/csm/2017/06/1034591_3_illustration_clay-collins_standard.png?alias=square_400x400] <https://click.cssubs.com/?qs=94b76946b672381ab9f862a7a8330823dae9e85f9eda0548f1833d328765739550de375f8f57c26f894ffdda246c045b00197a421e84b288>  Clayton Collins  Director, editorial innovation  [image: twitter] @ClayCollinsCSM <https://twitter.com/ClayCollinsCSM?cmpid=ema:ddp:20190812&src=email> [image: Daily facebook share] <https://click.cssubs.com/?qs=94b76946b672381a2e991ff17725879154c8e08a636ff1c10e602a64d42aa0767526370206b0358f030805f4494efd6d3b23d52f4ff95a6e> [image: Daily twitter share] <https://click.cssubs.com/?qs=94b76946b672381afcf012962b05c3f72801e8b12cbd0b3dfe43bb1dff8f603a816aefeb96492c3160559c4f9a6c7c3e40dc78335f4ef23a> [image: Daily email share] <?subject=I+think+you%27ll+like+this+article+from+the+Monitor+Daily&body=Here's+the+article+on+CSMonitor.com:+%0A%0A+Growing+back+better+after+an+epic+wildfire+%0A%0A+https://www.csmonitor.com/Daily/2019/20190812/Growing-back-better-after-an-epic-wildfire?src=shared+%0A%0A+You+can+try+the+Monitor+Daily+free+for+a+week:+https://www.csmonitor.com/dailyfreetrial> 1. Illegal border crossing: How U.S. guns wind up in Canada and Mexico <https://www.csmonitor.com/Daily/2019/20190812?cmpid=ema:ddp:20190812&src=email#1093943>  Security is a two-way street. The cross-border movement of migrants gets more media attention because of its direction; we asked our reporter to look at reactions to traffic in U.S.-originating guns.  – Clayton The 30 Sec. Read  Guns bought from vendors in the United States and then smuggled illegally abroad are a fact of life across the Americas. But the mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, this month have emboldened foreign stances against lax U.S. gun laws and shifted conversations about what that means for crime and safety north and south of the U.S. border.  Weaker gun regulations in the U.S. have long undermined Canada’s much stricter rules, as guns get trafficked north. The U.S. massacres came the same weekend as 17 shootings in 14 different incidents across Toronto. Border Security Minister Bill Blair said Canada could reduce violence with more money toward stopping guns from the U.S., which he called “the greatest arsenal in the world.”  Some 70% of guns recovered by law enforcement in Mexico and sent to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) between 2011 and 2016 were originally purchased from a licensed U.S. dealer. And of course, more than a third of those killed were Mexican citizens – prompting a withering response from Mexico.  President Andrés Manuel López Obrador urged U.S. leaders to reflect upon the “indiscriminate sale of guns.” Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard went further, threatening to open up a terrorist probe across the border.

What Russian deal? Israel and Jordan cast wary eye toward Syria. <https://www.csmonitor.com/Daily/2019/20190812?cmpid=ema:ddp:20190812&src=email#1093888> Ammar Awad/Reuters  The setting of hard lines, with consequences, is as standard in foreign policy as it is in parenting. As one analyst says, citing southern Syria, it’s also “a game of brinkmanship where you can lose control.”  – Clayton The 30 Sec. Read  Russia, the main power broker in Syria, pledged to both Israel and Jordan in 2018 that security arrangements for the south would keep Iranian forces 70 to 80 kilometers from their borders. Israel and Jordan took that pledge to include Iran’s proxies, especially Hezbollah.  But one year later evidence is solidifying that the Lebanese Shiite militant group has become increasingly entrenched in the area. Former Free Syrian Army rebels who have returned to their hometowns in southern Syria after an amnesty agreement with the Assad regime say Hezbollah is effectively “governing” several towns and villages.  Now concern is growing among Israel, Jordan, and regional analysts that an unintended and potentially “devastating” escalation may be around the corner. “Russia promised that the Iranians and militias would be driven out from southern Syria, and Russia did not deliver the goods,” says Ely Karmon, at the International Institute for Counter-Terrorism in Herzliya, Israel.  “We want the U.S. to maintain a presence in Syria, but also to provide diplomacy to give everyone an off-ramp,” says one Arab diplomat, who requested anonymity. “If the U.S. does not create that ramp, we don’t know who can.” <https://www.csmonitor.com/Daily/2019/20190812?cmpid=ema:ddp:20190812&src=email#1093888> Jacob Turcotte/Staff  By *Taylor Luck* Read 6 min. <https://www.csmonitor.com/Daily/2019/20190812?cmpid=ema:ddp:20190812&src=email&id=1093888>  ( 1250 words ) [image: Daily facebook share] <https://click.cssubs.com/?qs=94b76946b672381a230f5947679cc76d03f6313cc8fe9e58565facfb9cbd63bc6b91f3ea7b07f3cb516ecf15d1b00840e0a64f3f4f20bd1d> [image: Daily twitter share] <https://click.cssubs.com/?qs=94b76946b672381af6a695af038cee6a42cc3fb6e7326a3416f3f104e39a5643008eae488c7f924e38ee45d2672a40c421f04630d0a026fe> [image: Daily email share] <?subject=I+think+you%27ll+like+this+article+from+the+Monitor+Daily&body=Here's+the+article+on+CSMonitor.com:+%0A%0A+What+Russian+deal?%20Israel%20and%20Jordan%20cast%20wary%20eye%20toward%20Syria.+%0A%0A+https://www.csmonitor.com/Daily/2019/20190812/What-Russian-deal-Israel-and-Jordan-cast-wary-eye-toward-Syria?src=shared+%0A%0A+You+can+try+the+Monitor+Daily+free+for+a+week:+https://www.csmonitor.com/dailyfreetrial> 3. Why Guatemala’s next president is already bound by Trump <https://www.csmonitor.com/Daily/2019/20190812?cmpid=ema:ddp:20190812&src=email#1093946> Santiago Billy/AP  Stop migrants, or pay a price. That’s more or less the choice the U.S. administration has given Guatemala. But will it reduce migration – or just change whose problem it is?  – Clayton The 30 Sec. Read  Guatemala’s new president-elect, Alejandro Giammattei, won’t actually enter office for several months. But one day after the election, he’s already inherited a hornet’s nest from his predecessor: an unpopular migration deal with the United States.  Threatened by President Donald Trump with possible tariffs, taxes on remittances, and a travel ban, current President Jimmy Morales agreed to require asylum-seekers traveling through Guatemala to apply for asylum there, effectively cutting off requests from Salvadorans and Hondurans at the U.S. border. The U.S. administration has pressured Mexico to sign a similar agreement.  Critics argue that Guatemala, which is the No. 1 country of origin for people apprehended on the U.S. border this year, is in no position to give safety, or much opportunity. Last year, the country’s asylum system processed only 262 applications.  In the border region of Huehuetenango, a highland state that has one of Guatemala’s highest migration levels, Helen Mauricio Palacios sat on a motorbike outside the polls with her 5-year-old and her groceries, deciding whether it was worthwhile to cast her vote – whether either candidate would bring change.  “If we were a safe country, there would not be so many people migrating from here,” she says. “If people could find the success here that they’re searching for elsewhere, they wouldn’t leave.” <https://www.csmonitor.com/Daily/2019/20190812?cmpid=ema:ddp:20190812&src=email#1093946> Karen Norris/Staff  By *Maya Averbuch* Read 6 min. <https://www.csmonitor.com/Daily/2019/20190812?cmpid=ema:ddp:20190812&src=email&id=1093946>  ( 1267 words ) [image: Daily facebook share] <https://click.cssubs.com/?qs=94b76946b672381a9b9489529f0578155257ebe4710b6457431df260d8e4f84233c30fd11093604e3fd927adf1cf5230198ab3a278c8143d> [image: Daily twitter share] <https://click.cssubs.com/?qs=94b76946b672381a3e02dd10e84d13e462b234aec56396e52b66cd894c2243fa9ae178921d76b8d7d3e8c9f7d38d12e1ebb2c8465b29529a> [image: Daily email share] <?subject=I+think+you%27ll+like+this+article+from+the+Monitor+Daily&body=Here's+the+article+on+CSMonitor.com:+%0A%0A+Why+Guatemala’s+next+president+is+already+bound+by+Trump+%0A%0A+https://www.csmonitor.com/Daily/2019/20190812/Why-Guatemala-s-next-president-is-already-bound-by-Trump?src=shared+%0A%0A+You+can+try+the+Monitor+Daily+free+for+a+week:+https://www.csmonitor.com/dailyfreetrial> A deeper look 4. Woodstock at 50: How it shaped a generation <https://www.csmonitor.com/Daily/2019/20190812?cmpid=ema:ddp:20190812&src=email#1093947> Melanie Stetson Freeman/Staff  At a time of upheaval, one music festival defined an era with its counterculture spirit of protest, peace, and equality. Fifty years later, in the midst of similar unrest, its message, and mythology, endure.  – Clayton The 30 Sec. Read  Many Americans would dismiss the gathering as a bacchanalia in the mud – three days of drugs, nudity, subversive music, and psychedelic indulgence. But 50 years ago, Woodstock became a cultural touchstone that defined an era. A number of social protest movements of the 1960s – opposition to the Vietnam War, a push for free love and personal autonomy, a clamor for civil rights and equality – seemed to converge in that field in upstate New York.  Nowadays, the hippie is an endangered species and the idea of music as a counterculture movement doesn’t resonate with a younger generation. Yet in some ways, there are parallels between the idealism of the Woodstock generation and the so-called woke generation. Like their grandparents, the millennials and iGen display a zeal to change the world. Like their forebears, they’re willing to eschew some of the status symbol comforts they grew up with, like cars and homes.  David Crosby, a musician who performed at Woodstock, says the meaning of the festival remains with him. “Woodstock was a glimpse – a momentary glimpse – into what’s possible. Into us being able to live with each other decently and peacefully.”  By *Stephen Humphries* Read 15 min. <https://www.csmonitor.com/Daily/2019/20190812?cmpid=ema:ddp:20190812&src=email&id=1093947>  ( 3370 words ) [image: Daily facebook share] <https://click.cssubs.com/?qs=94b76946b672381ae7a57477642e8939f90f05dad3db22713bdb3be84b50d9a38c4c0efebb7ddef18c03ae248cf86631d46c2aeb4f46f58f> [image: Daily twitter share] <https://click.cssubs.com/?qs=94b76946b672381a1d5241154621449bf2958b350bbb9a255488a129ece877fe1dc0705ec34b9e621072c540308fc8fd15ead4da3fcb10c5> [image: Daily email share] <?subject=I+think+you%27ll+like+this+article+from+the+Monitor+Daily&body=Here's+the+article+on+CSMonitor.com:+%0A%0A+Woodstock+at+50:+How+it+shaped+a+generation+%0A%0A+https://www.csmonitor.com/Daily/2019/20190812/Woodstock-at-50-How-it-shaped-a-generation?src=shared+%0A%0A+You+can+try+the+Monitor+Daily+free+for+a+week:+https://www.csmonitor.com/dailyfreetrial> The Explainer 5. What is 5G, and how will it affect me? <https://www.csmonitor.com/Daily/2019/20190812?cmpid=ema:ddp:20190812&src=email#1093948>  The tech industry touts its next-generation cellphone network as a giant leap in capabilities. But the industry jargon does little to explain it to consumers. We look at what “5G” really means.  – Clayton The 30 Sec. Read  The name 5G stands simply for the fifth generation of cellphone service. In practical terms, that means a superfast and much more reliable service – plus the potential for the rise of an “internet of things” where items like home appliances are increasingly web-connected.  Some analysts worry about drawbacks. Rising prices are one issue. Also, 5G carriers will have to build a much denser network of small transmitters to complement today’s cell towers. Some critics have raised concerns that exposure to so many radio waves could have health effects. The industry says no studies have uncovered any problems. The other big concern is privacy, as more data goes online and is tracked.  The positives: Download speeds will ramp up, so you could download a full movie to your phone in seconds rather than minutes. Wireless companies could begin competing with cable firms to offer home internet and TV service. Your city’s traffic grid would communicate with cars and vice versa to reduce bottlenecks and improve safety. All this won’t happen at once. By 2025, just under half of Americans will have 5G connections, according to Deloitte.

Read  Since July 13, more than 7,000 gun owners in New Zealand have handed over their firearms to police under the country’s first program to buy back guns. “We have to do for the greater good of our society,” said one man as he handed over his AR-15 firearm.  The voluntary nature of gun buybacks gives them a special place in the worldwide debate over gun regulations.  In the United States, buybacks have been very popular since the 1990s, even though most scholars say they do not curb gun violence over time. In the U.S. presidential race, several Democratic contenders now advocate for buybacks after the recent mass shootings in Texas and Ohio.  Yet about 70% of gun owners say they could never imagine themselves not owning some sort of firearm.  Buyback programs help bring gun owners in contact with police and others in a community, fostering a dialogue about the ways to keep everyone safe.  While criminals or potential mass shooters are very unlikely to turn in their guns, their ability to find guns or their willingness to see gun use as normal can be diminished if enough owners decide society would be safer without guns.

Understanding the concept of infinity plays a key role in the practice of Christian Science, as one man found out when he prayed for a horse in need of healing. As he turned to God for inspiration, a powerful sense of God’s goodness as infinite came to him. That changed the way he saw the horse, which was soon free of all the ailments.

5000g000028cLMGAA2,BIG Thank you!!,"Greetings, jsh online editorial team—  fellow spiritual adventurers &spiritual  activists!  Here’s a long overdue thank-you to all jshonline editors and team members for the beautiful  new website formats and design  concepts that highlight the timely curated focus features  each week .   I look forward to these articles (online and in print)  as well as  the Sentinel Watch programs, which are all stepping up to bring  fresh perspectives, fresh inclusive language ,  to meet global humanity’s needs and in people’s lives today, as reflected in news (and hey, the Monitor ’s recent re-do is wonderful, too!!!)  I particularly like today’s (Aug. 16) ""Daily Lift""— the video on “You are the reflection  of God”  —  a big WOW for me .. because  it came as answer this morning as to how to share a video message about CS  (yes, SS videos are great, too)  with my grandsons in another state  who only occasionally attend   a CS Sunday School.And who are starting back to  (regular) school now.      This Daily Lift video format  is so easily shareable  for so-called non-readers or those who feel too busy  to take in much printed or even oral information… (Let’s see more of these video Daily Lifts, Marla Sammuli ? Amy Richmond? Thanks!!!)    I also find that the Sentinel articles, themes, (because of the caring editorial oversight  for providing spiritual meaning and depth  in contemporary, easy-to-read- and- understand terminology,   insights from authors’  personal stories-- in a friend-to-friend conversational way , and references to timely  books, news stories, etc.).  are  more easy for me to share, offer with those who may be new to or unfamiliar with CS.   I was grateful to see the editorial, “Prayer as activism” by guest editorial writer Mimi Oka, on July 8.  I thought.. YAY At last we  are acknowledging that prayer is truly the basis for citizen/community activism . Prayer  fuels all right action…to bless all mankind.   The article shows that  Jesus and Mrs. Eddy were “spiritual activists,” and we can be, too.  Thanks!  (And maybe jshonline Sentinel editors will consider curating some future focus articles that feature “Spiritual activism”  — there have been quite a few actually, and it is a fun exploration!)   I especially want to send huge thanks to Tony Lobl and Rita Polatin, for the more informal,  (spontaneous—“ live"") conversations on Sentinel Watch programs. These podcasts are getting better all the time in speaking  the language of everyday folks about their concerns and sharing the practicality of CS  approach to such issues.  I shared the  interview( with Bill Moody on democracy, government )with a neighbor who is totally opposite and sometimes aggressive in her political views and choice of news sources,  but who is increasingly interested in CS Monitor articles I’ve shared, and who loved the Sentinel Watch interview, saying. “I wish everyone thought this way.”)   And, another shout-out --of YAY,  hallelujah!  thanks—  to new Associate Editor Larissa Snorek for your recent Sentinel editorials, but especially   “The healing touch of humor.”(Aug. 12) and one I just read yesterday, coming out Aug. 26 issue, “Out of darkness into light.” Nothing connects with me faster than music and humor to cut through the fog of animal magnetism.   And humor is something that is SO needed today  lighten , enlighten, and lift “tired”  humanity  out of the plodding sense of burdensome beliefs, the “mantle” of “seriousness” instead of the ""garment of praise"" and “songs of everlasting joy.”…  joy with each one of us. Everywhere. Always.   Also, hey Larissa…  you delivered your lecture, “The Healing Power of Stillness” in our Washington DC metro  area over last couple of years, and I gotta say,  you are right-on in selecting this topic. I note that in your online intro to upcoming CSJournal (Sept. 2019) you also  mentions the idea of stillness . Thought you’d like to know , since  I work as writer with our DC CSMedia Committee...  (we are working on new digital marketing to support  CS lectures in the area —for  some 22 churches — and also in progress now of designing new website), Lari, YOUR TOPIC of “stillness” received the most clicks  from responsive truth-seekers (everyday searchers on Google Adwords topics)  which took them to ur  CSDC website ,  in the online digital campaign we  did last spring.   So, bravo! The topic  of “mindfulness,” finding peace, stillness, is a BIG draw these days!!  And what a treasured Resource we have to share!  **(I did not write this letter to share for publication, but if any nuggets from this may help other readers  ,  ok, I guess feel free to edit/use.)

Something I recognize as an ongoing process in todays society is the longing for sustainability.

However, it appears that I had already used up the 10 allowable downloads on 3 of the hymns. I think it might be showing this way because I had tried to stream them on my phone (since I had not yet had the opportunity to download them on my computer). Is there a way I can be allowed one more download so I can truly download them on my computer? Or do I need to repurchase those three individual hymns? My order # is 5500028540.

However, the poll also found that about 35% of those surveyed say they are still unfamiliar and uneducated concerning CBD products.  This information proves that CBD is booming, especially among millennials, however it also shows that a big chunk of adults are unfamiliar with exactly what it is and what it can help with. Which leads to the pressing question: With the explosion of CBD, why are so many people still uneducated?

5000g000028bmeCAAQ,"White Privilege, by Shannon Sullivan  -   (REVIEW COPY? INTERVIEW REQUESTS?)","Publishing November 3, 2019   ** ------------------------------------------------------------  Some embrace the idea of white privilege as an important concept that helps us to make sense of the connection between race and social and political disadvantages, while others are critical or even hostile. Regardless of personal views, it can be difficult to agree on what 'white privilege' even means.  Philosopher Shannon Sullivan cuts through the confusion and cross-talk to challenge what ‘everybody knows’ about white privilege. Using real-life examples, she offers a candid assessment of the advantages and disadvantages of the term, to present a better understanding of how race functions in our societies. She argues that white privilege is about more than race, that not only white people can have white privilege,and that feeling guilty about privilege can have a negative effect on the very people you feel guilty towards. In the end, she offers practical solutions for eliminating white privilege and building a fairer society.  Sullivan's forcefully argued book will inspire you to think again about white privilege and what it entails.  The Author:  Shannon Sullivan is Professor of Philosophy at the University of North Carolina, Charlotte.

5000g000028cPiqAAE,Your account was under attack! Change your credentials!,"Hello!  I am a hacker who has access to your operating system. I also have full access to your account.  I've been watching you for a few months now. The fact is that you were infected with malware through an adult site that you visited.  If you are not familiar with this, I will explain. Trojan Virus gives me full access and control over a computer or other device. This means that I can see everything on your screen, turn on the camera and microphone, but you do not know about it.  I also have access to all your contacts and all your correspondence.  Why your antivirus did not detect malware? Answer: My malware uses the driver, I update its signatures every 4 hours so that your antivirus is silent.  I made a video showing how you satisfy yourself in the left half of the screen, and in the right half you see the video that you watched. With one click of the mouse, I can send this video to all your emails and contacts on social networks. I can also post access to all your e-mail correspondence and messengers that you use.  If you want to prevent this, transfer the amount of $500 to my bitcoin address (if you do not know how to do this, write to Google: ""Buy Bitcoin"").  My bitcoin address (BTC Wallet) is:  3GqNx1o9trJ89Qwn8mSn1nZVnV42b1Lzib  After receiving the payment, I will delete the video and you will never hear me again. I give you 50 hours (more than 2 days) to pay. I have a notice reading this letter, and the timer will work when you see this letter.  Filing a complaint somewhere does not make sense because this email cannot be tracked like my bitcoin address. I do not make any mistakes.

Dr. Rodney L. Petersen ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Religion and Citizenship Among the challenges for nation-states in the twenty-first century is the degree  of allegiance citizens give to local, national, and international participation. Summertime politics have revolved around the implications of these interlaced spheres of allegiance and identities called into question. In its own way CMM's Interfaith Youth Initiative (IFYI) serves to help youth navigate these relationships. The concept and practice of citizenship emerged out of what it meant to be part  of a tribe, to be a ""subject,"" or even a ""national."" The aftermath of the American and French Revolutions in the eighteenth century saw the emergence of civil citizenship.The idea of political citizenship can be seen to have arisen in the nineteenth century, that of social citizenship in the twentieth century. Following this sense of evolution from narrowly defined loyalty to greater civic tolerance, the idea of an emergent global citizenship with religious rights and responsibilities has arisen as a growing social reality. Programs that alert us to voter and other rights grow out of these political realities. Sociologist Elise Boulding connects the evolution of political consciousness with the principles that led to the emergence of the United Nations. She argues that  a new model of citizenship that is multicultural - involving respect for all groups within the state - multinational and multidimensional is on our political horizon: a threefold citizenship to local community, the nation-state, and global agreements. In this context, religious citizenship is a dimension of citizenship at each level. Rather than regressive in its commitments, religion offers deep meaning, the energy for moral vision and a means to reconciliation and peace that is increasingly recognized. The idea of faith connected with social justice is central to CMM's vision of social engagement.

The  impact of gun violence goes beyond mass shootings; in recent weeks gun violence  has devastated communities across the country including Baltimore, Chicago, Gilroy, Canoga Park, Brooklyn, El Paso, Dayton and many more.

He is passionate about educating farmers, policymakers and others about ""the soil carbon sponge"" and its crucial role in reversing and mitigating flooding, drought, wildfires, and searing global temperatures. He shows us how we can safely cool the climate and restore essential biodiversity by repairing our disrupted hydrological cycles. We thus return excess carbon to the soils, where it can build a sponge that soaks up water and revives the biosphere! Join us on Monday, August 26 from 6:30pm to 8:30pm at the Cambridge Public Library, 449 Broadway, Cambridge MA. Biodiversity for a Livable Climate is a small non-profit so a $10 donation is requested. Students have free admission.

MAY WE FOREVER STAND"": MASSACHUSETTS COMMEMORATES 400 YEARS OF BLACK RESILIENCY The year 2019 marks 400 years since the first enslaved Africans set foot in Jamestown, Virginia. Since then, Black communities have demonstrated remarkable resiliency  in the face of cruelty, terror, and systematic oppression. African Americans have not only created pathways to survive but, in many instances, to thrive. Through  it all, the Black Church has endured as a beacon of hope and testimony to resurrection. On September 20, 2019, people of faith will gather to honor ancestors, commemorate 400 years of resiliency, and pray for an end to systemic and racial injustice.

5000g000028brCvAAI,This Childhood Nutritionist Says Food Pouches Are Bad For Your Babies (Modern Parenthood),"Hi Stephanie --  A WHO study just found that half of baby foods analyzed obtained more than 30% of calories from sugar, concentrated fruit juice or other sweetener. This essentially trains kids to crave sweet foods, leading to childhood obesity, adult diabetes and heart disease.  But the problem is much deeper: Those food pouches our kids love have been linked to childhood obesity, speech delays and problems with motor skills development.  Here’s why you should avoid giving your kid any food squeezed from a pouch:  #1 THEY DON'T LEARN FOOD TEXTURES  According to expert Amy Shapiro  of Real Nutrition NYC, pouches don’t include spoons, tools which actually help introduce your baby to see and try new textures without scaring them (for example, potatoes). Without  a spoon, your little one is just drinking food.  #2 PROMOTES DELAYS IN MOTOR SKILLS  Pouches have been linked to speech delays and issues with motor skills, because kids are squeezing food in their mouth instead of practicing hand/eye coordination to put food in their mouth, which is an important developmental milestones. The prolonged sucking motion of a pouch, beyond the bottle phase, also impacts speech development.  #3 UNDERMINES SOCIAL EATING  When a child is munching on a pouch in the car for lunch or on the couch, they’re not learning to appreciate food as nourishment, understanding their body cues, or really experiencing a meal as “social time” around a table with the entire family.  #4 KIDS DON'T LEARN TUMMY CUES  Kids are squeezing food in their mouths in large gulps instead of savoring each spoonful. The “one spoonful at a time” approach gives babies the space to learn to eat when they’re hungry and to stop eating when they’re full.  With Fresh Bellies baby food (freshbellies.com), kids learn to eat how they should - from a cup with a spoon - and without masking vegetables with things like sweet fruit.  Available for interviews or write-ups:  > Childhood nutritionist, Amy Shapiro of Real Nutrition NYC > Fresh Bellies founder Saskia Sorrosa, who can talk about how to teach kids to eat to eat veggies without ""lying"".  They are available for in-person (NY), email or phone interviews.  Saskia can also talk about:  * Why there's no such thing as a ""picky eater"" * How to get your kids to love garlic, peppers, chard, and exotic herbs * The problem with baby food marketing.

As a child, I watched my father work tirelessly to build businesses. Some were successful. Other were not. I now know my father was not alone in his plight because Bloomberg Research suggests that 8 out of every 10 businesses fail within the first 19 months. The Small Business Administration suggests that only half of new businesses survive the first five years, while only 35% are able to survive for 10 years. Despite my early exposure to the unfortunate side of entrepreneurship, I have come to believe that what sets the successful and the unsuccessful apart is not luck, worth ethic, or even skill. Most times, it comes down to the power of flexibility.  When you first become an entrepreneur, you are inundated with solicited and unsolicited advice. There is an incredible adrenaline rush that comes from seeing yourself manifest what had only been a vision in your mind for weeks, months, and sometimes even years. Most of the advice is given with good intentions and meant to be motivational. Yet, some have absolutely no significance to you because your primary concern early on is simply to survive.

5000g000028bidzAAA,HomeAway/Vrbo to Collect Vacation Rental Tax in Mass - What does this mean? Interview Avail,"Hi Stephanie,  This month, all eyes are on Massachusetts in the vacation rental industry. As of Aug 1, Vrbo/HomeAway has officially ""turned on"" vacation rental tax collection and remittance in the state. So why is it you (probably) haven't heard about this? The answer is that Vrbo and HomeAway aren't exactly broadcasting this move, and while they are collecting and remitting some state lodging taxes...there is a good chance that in any given local municipality there are additional local taxes owed which are still up to the homeowner to understand, collect from their renters and remit to the correct agency (and at the right time) independently of what Vrbo/HomeAway are collecting. Confusing, right?!  So, what does this mean for Massachusetts' growing short-term rental market? Why is Vrbo/HomeAway choosing to cooperate now with statewide lodging tax collection/remittance efforts? Why aren't they collecting ALL the necessary taxes for their users? How can vacation rental owners figure out how much they need to collect, who that money needs to go to, and when? How does this change in Massachusetts stack up against the broader trend toward legislation and taxation in the vacation rental space across the country? And what is the hotel industry's role in lodging taxes being collected by Vrbo/HomeAway in the state)?   I'd love to offer an interview with Rob Stephens, a vacation rental owner himself and the preeminent expert on the short-term vacation rental market as the founder and general manager of Avalara MyLodgeTax (https://www.avalara.com/mylodgetax/en/index.html) , the first and only tax collection and remittance software used by Airbnb, VRBO, HomeAway and virtually every major regional and national vacation rental platform. Rob keeps a close eye on the rapidly evolving landscape of the vacation rental industry and regulations being introduced both on a national and state level. He's been following these developments in Massachusetts very closely and can provide insight into both the local and national impact of what's happening.   Just let me know if you have any interest in an interview for Christian Science Monitor, The and I'll be more than happy to make that happen. Thanks!

Watch the Youtube trailer here. ( https://mychristiandaily.com/?email_id=799&user_id=93437&urlpassed=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g%2Fdj1BU1QyLTRkYjRpYyZhbXA7ZmVhdHVyZT15b3V0dS5iZQ&controller=stats&action=analyse&wysija-page=1&wysijap=subscriptions ) In Gerwig’s take, the beloved story of the March sisters – four young women each determined to live life on her own terms — is both timeless and timely. Portraying Jo, Meg, Amy, and Beth March, the film stars Saoirse Ronan, Emma Watson, Florence Pugh, Eliza Scanlen, with Timothée Chalamet as their neighbor Laurie, Laura Dern as Marmee, and Meryl Streep as Aunt March.

I've been watching you for a few months now. The fact is that you were infected with malware through an adult site that you visited.  If you are not familiar with this, I will explain. Trojan Virus gives me full access and control over a computer or other device. This means that I can see everything on your screen, turn on the camera and microphone, but you do not know about it.  I also have access to all your contacts and all your correspondence.  Why your antivirus did not detect malware?

5000g000028cRlZAAU,"Re: After mass shootings, Republicans wrestle with politics of race","I think before we fight white supremacy we need to Define what it is! I grew up in a nation that was 85 to 95% White is it white supremacy if I want to maintain that? By such a definition all of the founding fathers and all of the presidents of the United States up until the 1960s would be white supremacist! And the fact of the madman use the invasion of America by Mexico as an excuse to commit heinous acts does not there for justify the illegal Invasion by Mexico! Any more than the fact that the Dayton Ohio Mass killer being a socialist and Elizabeth Warren supporter mixed socialism and Elizabeth Warren evil!

But first, let’s look at Toni Morrison’s legacy. The first African American woman to win a Nobel Prize in literature (1993) died Monday. Her novels lyrically and unflinchingly plumbed slavery, sisterhood, racism, justice, sexual abuse, rage, guilt, and liberty. She’s “a national treasure ... ,” wrote former President Barack Obama today, “a challenge to our conscience and a call to greater empathy.”She leaves an indelible mark on America and a generation of black writers. I asked Monitor culture critic Candace McDuffie what Ms. Morrison means to her.  “Toni Morrison made me feel valued and seen in a genre where we are usually neglected,” writes Candace in an email. “In white American literature, black women are either completely ignored or reduced to racist tropes. We are not docile Mammys, nor are we hypersexual Jezebels or inexplicably angry Sapphires. We are multidimensional and beautiful beings whose experiences run deep. Morrison managed to embody our complexities through works that showcased our humanity and wholeness.”Candace respects that Ms. Morrison “never jeopardized her artistic integrity. ... Topics like slavery and racism and colorism and black feminism dominated her works and were powerful and revelatory because Morrison prioritized black authenticity over white comfort. And because of this, she will always be one of the most important writers of our time.” Ms. Morrison will be missed. But her unique expression of dignity, defiance, and cultural honesty endures. As Mr. Obama wrote, “time is no match” for her works.

And while some in the party see an urgent need to take a strong moral stand, others see a political trap – since many Democrats are arguing that it is hypocritical for any Republican to denounce white supremacy unless he or she also denounces President Donald Trump. Still, the shift in thought is significant, observers say. Fighting white supremacy will require leaders from both sides of the aisle to consistently and specifically condemn it wherever it emerges, says Cynthia Miller-Idriss, an American University professor who studies far-right youth extremism. “I do think this is a genuine shift happening,” Ms. Miller-Idriss says. “We’re seeing a much stronger condemnation now than we have in the past.”                                                                                                                                By                Jessica Mendoza                                                                                            By                Linda Feldmann                                                                        --  To unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to daily+unsubscribe@csps.com.",8/17/2019 0:00,,,Junk,,,FALSE
5000g000028cQeIAAU,Women Should be at Core of U.S. Talks on Withdrawal from Afghanistan,"View this email in your browser (https://mailchi.mp/marianne2020/women_afghan_8_17_19-254129?e=86750cd953) https://www.marianne2020.com/ FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE August 17, 2019 Patricia Ewing Communications Director Press@marianne2020.com (mailto:Press@marianne2020.com) 443-906-1495   Women Should be at Core of U.S. Talks on Withdrawal from Afghanistan Marianne Williamson today reminded the Trump administration that any deal made to withdraw U.S. troops from Afghanistan without ensuring the rights and protection of women is unacceptable. Williamson has said for years that engaging the women of Afghanistan is necessary for any successful and lasting plan for the withdrawal of U.S. troops and for creating peace in the region. Williamson said, “The Taliban’s history of brutality towards women must not be forgotten or ignored in these negotiations.”  Women in Afghanistan have made gains in education, employment and political spheres in Kabul, but any gains made in rural areas controlled by the Taliban are still slow and not guaranteed. Williamson called upon the Trump administration to make certain that women are included in the talks, and that safeguards for women’s roles in the economy and government are included in every phase of the talks.  Williamson said, “As President, I would make no move in Afghanistan until I talk to the women. I want to hear from them first. I am well aware of the history of the Taliban in relationship to Afghan women, so nothing happens until I talk to them.”  ###  ============================================================ ** (https://twitter.com/marwilliamson) ** (https://www.facebook.com/williamsonmarianne/) ** (https://www.instagram.com/mariannewilliamson/) ** (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXAMXGAP0YnBxtc8brSSbjg) ** (https://www.marianne2020.com) Copyright © 2019 Marianne Williamson for President, All rights reserved.

Brouwer takes the initiative in his insightful book, How to Become a Multicultural Church. Drawing upon his own experiences as a pastor in Zurich, Switzerland, where 30 percent of the population hails from elsewhere, he shares his discerning wisdom on issues such as language barriers, theological differences and cultural stereotypes.   I would be happy to send you a complimentary copy of this thought-provoking book in consideration of an interview, review or feature. Please read the following press release, and contact me to schedule an interview. I'd also be happy to send you JPEGs of Brouwer and the book cover. Thank you.

Brouwer, a seasoned American pastor, took on the unique challenge of serving a multiethnic, multiracial, multicultural church in one of Europe's largest cities — Zurich, Switzerland, where 30 percent of the population comes from somewhere else. Between the covers of How to Become a Multicultural Church, Brouwer distills the lessons he learned from that experience into timely wisdom on issues every multicultural church faces, including language barriers, theological differences and cultural stereotypes.   A multicultural church, he posits, is one with an intentional engagement of cultures — not just a mix of races and nationalities. Honestly recounting his own questions and challenges in multicultural ministry, and writing in the form of a memoir of his experience, Brouwer shows how churches everywhere can adjust attitudes and practices to embrace racial, ethnic and cultural diversity.  How to Become a Multicultural Church includes chapters on topics such as reconsidering a church's name, being theologically generous and taking an honest look at what the church's flag might mean.   Many churches aspire to be more culturally diverse but lack a practical approach. How to Become a Multicultural Church identifies 10 factors that contribute to the life and vitality of a genuinely multicultural church to help churches everywhere support their efforts toward diversity.  Author Douglas J. Brouwer spent 40 years serving churches in Illinois, Michigan, Florida and Switzerland before retiring to Michigan.

How to Become a Multicultural Church  Publisher: Eerdmans Publishing Company  ISBN-10: 0802873936  ISBN-13: 978-0802873934 Available from Amazon.com, BarnesandNoble.com and Eerdmans.com  ###  TIP SHEET  Q & As available upon request.  Excerpts from online reviews:   ""In an age when diversity can be demonized, Doug Brouwer reveals its beauty as the heart of the gospel and the embodiment of the kingdom of God on earth. Through his rich pastoral experience, particularly at the beloved IPC, he reveals the joys, frustrations and gifts that emerge in a multicultural congregation. He is an honest, seasoned and wise guide who will fill readers with the hope that Pentecost is still possible today.”  ""One of the key takeaways from this book is the reminder that there is a difference between being multi-racial and multi-cultural. One can have an ethnically diverse church that is still monocultural… many multiracial or multiethnic churches continue to reflect the liturgical and governing style of the dominant culture … Perhaps the most important lesson here has to do with the vision, and finding ways of moving toward its fulfillment.”   ""Anyone living in this shrinking world of ours, constantly rubbing shoulders with the 'other' (whoever that might be), would benefit from his gentle nudges, clear clarifications and urge to move forward with respect, hospitality and acceptance.”  ""Even as someone with no intentions to enter the ministry or start a church, I found it a fascinating read, and one that bridges the gap between churches (a more conservative topic) and multiculturalism (a more liberal topic) without ruffling too many feathers.”  Possible discussion topics for Douglas J. Brouwer:  1)    At a time when people are worried about immigration and its impact  on American life, the church has an opportunity to reach beyond the  dominant (white) culture and find ways to include the lost, marginalized,  vulnerable, etc. 2)    What it was like living in a decidedly multicultural environment in one of  Europe's most important cities. 3)    Multiculturalism has been a failure in several western countries, but some  have had more success than others.

5000g000028cQWYAA2,Desiring a conversation with college students,"Dear Editors,  A wonderful thing happened recently. While purchasing a copy of the 2017 Hymnal at a local branch church's Reading Room, I happened to glance down at the counter where I was standing, and saw a pamphlet, titled ""*Engaging with the Monitor*"". I quickly picked it up, and handed it to the librarian and asked her to include it with the Hymnal. Several minutes later, a woman came out of the study room, turned towards me and said, ""You should have ""*Step By Step*"". It's great for college students"". Wow! A miracle. How did she know I've been cherishing the idea of sharing Christian Science with college students? Later, I recalled what Mrs. Eddy said about ""miracle"". ""The miracle of grace is no miracle to Love"" (S&H, p. 494:15-16). So, no problem. This woman, whom I had never met, voiced my need, and with a warm, radiant smile, met it. After she left the Ladies Room, she came over to the counter and showed me ""Step By Step"". The librarian said it was the only copy for sale - one was in the Study Room. Without hesitation, I knew I would purchase the one for sale. What a joyous day it was at that Reading Room!  I found myself reminiscing afterwards, about an experience I had at Teacher's College, Columbia University. Last year, passing through the corridor on my way home, I noticed a group of hashtags posted on one side of the wall. I went closer and saw that these hashtags, ""Arm Me With"", were put up by students at the College. I quickly went across to the lounge nearby, dropped by briefcase, took out my cell phone, came back to the wall and took pictures. When I arrived home, I looked at them and saw that these students were asking for some of what I've seen as subjects in the Christian Science magazines. Then, I counted them and found I had photographed sixteen and remembered that that number is stated in the Manual. Mrs. Eddy used it as a requirement for starting a branch church (Manual, p. 72:26), and so there was no hesitation when the thought came to put each hashtag on 2-inch square paper, fold them twice, and put them in the big vase on the top level of a desk in the Reading Room. All I had to do now, was know that ""Divine Love always has met and always will meet every human needs"" (S&H, p. 494: 10-11).  Another college incident is keeping the desire for sharing Christian Science on college campuses. Happened in October, 2014, when John Tyler gave his Talk for my branch church. He spoke at Union Theological Seminary, directly across the street (Broadway) from Teacher's College. The title of his Talk, ""Can we break the chains of materialism?"", was an interesting title for college students. He used scenes and ideas from the film ""Matrix"" as a metaphor. Shortly after his talk, another branch church in New York City asked him to lecture for them. The title was 'Beyond the sixth sense"". I took invites to a few colleges and in one Psychology Department, they immediately posted a flyer on their bulletin board. I thought, here is Christian Science, reaching out to college students. So wonderful! I'm asking myself, could the incidents mentioned above be a prelude to conversations with college student? I want to answer - Yes. If yes, then I must continue to know what Mrs. Eddy says in Science and Health: ""Desire is prayer; and no loss can occur from trusting God with our desires, that they may be molded as exalted before they they form in words and in deeds"" (p 1:11). I am looking forward to having conversation with college students.  Lovingly, Marie Lawrence",8/17/2019 0:00,,,Junk,,,FALSE

5000g000028cQTtAAM,Sept 8 - The Day Faith Leaders End Food Waste,"[cid:image001.png@01D554F0.E6C8A110]  Hello,  Re: Important information for all clergy in the Church of Christ, Scientist.  We are now only a few weeks from Food Waste Weekend - the global event for the entire faith community. Food Waste Weekend takes place September 6-8, 2019. I am asking for your help in sharing the attached information with every faith leader in your community.  Food Waste Weekend helps Christian (and other religions too) faith leaders prepare sermons on the important issue of ending food waste - important because reducing the waste of food reduces hunger, climate change and improves the environment.  This is an opportunity to speak about ending hunger rather than just feeding the hungry. The scriptures speak of food waste but most faith leaders have never actually discussed it.  Everything your ministers/priests/pastors will need, including an introduction to the issue of food waste, a sample sermon from the Christian perspective, sample bulletins for their newsletters, and even a game show for the Sunday school, are all available at FoodWasteWeekend.org<http://www.foodwasteweekend.org/christian>/Christian.  We also have material for individual Christians who either don't or can't go to church at FoodWasteWeekend.org/IAmChristian<http://www.foodwasteweekend.org/IAmChristian>.  Food Waste Weekend, endorsed by the National Council of Churches and other faith groups, was created 3 years ago by a nonprofit called AmpleHarvest.org which was founded by a CNN Hero and World Food Prize nominee. They work to help billions of pounds of excess fresh food get to more than 8,500 food pantries nationwide. Important:  If your church has a food pantry, make sure they sign up at AmpleHarvest.org/food-pantries<http://ampleharvest.org/food-pantries> to get fresh food that would have otherwise been lost to waste.  It's free!  Imagine imams talking about food waste on Friday, rabbis on Saturday, and ministers and priests on Sunday (along with other faith leaders). All with the goal of reducing the waste of food and hunger, and all on the same weekend. That's powerful!  Everything you need to get started is available at FoodWasteWeekend.org<http://www.foodwasteweekend.org/christian>/Christian. Note that if Sept 8 does not work for you, do it on another Sunday that works better.  All of the material remains available all year.  Please share this with all faith leaders in the Church of Christ, Scientist.  Additional material is available at FoodWasteWeekend.org/launch<http://www.foodwasteweekend.org/launcch>.

5000g000028cHXoAAM,RUSI Defence and Security Newsletter,"Good morning, ,  A delivery truck, a low hanging wire and a slow response from my ISP have conspired  to suspend this newsletter for several weeks. Now back in operation, we can  begin to look at a number of events around the globe that interest us.  The most visible situation is the continued incarceration of Canadians Michael  Kovrig and Michael Spavor by China. I note that this has not been recently  in the news and I fear that these two people may drop from public attention.  They have been in a Chinese prison for 249 days -- eight months, and there  doesn't appear to be much ink or air time given to it by Canadian news media.  The more jaded of us may say that this situation does not warrant the same  level of attention as it an old situation, however I believe that with each  passing day Canadians should be collectively demanding more assertive action  by our federal government and any provincial governments which may have any  influence.   Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland's contact information is:  Telephone: 613-992-5234  Fax: 613-996-9607  Email: Chrystia.Freeland@parl.gc.ca Postal address:  House of Commons, Ottawa, Ontario Canada K1A 0A6     Maritime Executive writer Mark Hoskin writes that China has a historic claim  on the South China Sea, that it purports to be internal waters. I doubt if  this makes China's claim more valid, but it is an interesting perspective to  take.  Clive Hamilton (Conversation Canada) warns that Australia ""must wake up to  the risks of researchers linked to China's military."" The same warning can  me directed to Canadian universities and business as well. Let us not lose  sight of the content of Johathan Manthorpe's recent book,  (https://www.amazon.ca/Claws-Panda-Beijings-Influence-Intimidation/dp/177086539X).  Clive Hamilton also authored Silent Invasion: China's Influence in Australia.     Al Jazeera's writer Leonid Ragozin believes that the current Russian pro-democracy  movement may jeopardize Vladimir Putin's hold on government.     *         *          *  This newsletter is a free service of the Royal United Services Institute of  Nova Scotia, whose volunteers work hard to provide information about Canadian  defence and security affairs at no cost.

5000g000028cDO9AAM,Tom Steyer Statement on Israel’s Decision to Bar Representatives Omar and Tlaib,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: Thursday, August 15, 2019 CONTACT: press@tomsteyer.com  Tom Steyer Statement on Israel’s Decision to Bar Representatives Omar and Tlaib  (SAN FRANCISCO, August 15, 2019) — Candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination Tom Steyer released the statement below following the decision by Israel to bar Democratic Representatives Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib from entering the country after receiving pressure from Donald Trump.  “Donald Trump’s demand that Israel bar the entry of Representatives Omar and Tlaib as U.S. officials is an affront to core American ideals. His divisive demands of our allies are contrary to the principles of free speech and open, vigorous dialogue.  Mr. Trump’s attempt to isolate, vilify, and stigmatize members of Congress with whom he disagrees strikes at the central notion of our democracy and continues his attempt to separate and divide Americans along racial and religious lines, and further his bigoted and destructive agenda.”  Paid for by Tom Steyer 2020.  ###  About Tom:  Tom Steyer left his successful investing business seven years ago to give his own money and all his time and energy to fighting for progressive causes. He soon became one of the country’s leading forces in registering more young voters and voters of color, fighting climate change, working for racial justice, and helping secure better lives for all Americans. Tom has led a number of people-first, grassroots campaigns that have repeatedly defeated powerful special interests, beating big oil to win clean air laws, forcing big tobacco to pay its share of healthcare costs, and closing a billion-dollar corporate tax loophole to fund public schools.  Tom and his wife Kat Taylor were early signers of the Giving Pledge, a commitment to give the bulk of his fortune to good causes before they die. Tom’s dedication to doing what is right comes from his parents. His father was a lawyer who prosecuted Nazis at the Nuremberg Trials; his mother was a journalist and teacher who volunteered to teach prisoners in New York City jails. Tom says his parents showed him the power of having the courage to do the right thing. Their greatest lesson, he says, was that our actions speak louder than our words – what we do is more important than what we say.  ============================================================ Tom Steyer 2020 | P.O.

5000g000028c287AAA,"As tuition fee costs rise, U.S. students turn to online jobs","Dear Stephanie,      Since 2012, the price of college in the United States has risen almost eight times quicker than wages.

Many thanks,  Eva        For immediate release      Transcription Jobs Growing in Popularity Amongst Students Seeking Remote Job Opportunities     Remote work becoming more attractive for students seeking more flexible working options to fit around their studies     August 14, 2019: In recent years, the cost of attending college in the United States has risen almost eight-times as fast as wages. As a result, many US-based students will struggle to make ends meet during their academic career.      As one way of offsetting the rise in living costs, around 50% of students undertake part-time work, and online jobs have been rising in popularity. These include app development, freelance writing, as well as translation.     One of the most popular forms of online work for students is transcription, which is the conversion of the spoken word to written text from audio or video files. Its popularity amongst students has been driven via its freelance nature, meaning students can fit it around their schedule by choosing to work as little or as much as they wish.     GoTranscript is a human-driven transcription service which employs both high-school and university students from across the globe as part of its 20,000-strong team of freelance transcribers. Earnings can reach up-to $1,250 per-month and employees are paid weekly.      As part of its corporate social responsibility (CSR) programme, the company also gives students the opportunity to earn a scholarship which pays $1,000 per-year during their course of study as a way of alleviating the increasing costs of living.      To apply, candidates must submit an essay of between 500 to 1000 words explaining how language has helped them as a vehicle for self-expression, as well as their personal and academic achievements. The application will then be assessed by a team of specialists.      Applications for the GoTranscript scholarship programme are open until 2022, and are accepted throughout the year.     In addition to its scholarship programme, GoTranscript offers academic transcription services as part of its commitment to students. Academic transcription is when a student records a lecture instead of taking notes. They then send it to the GoTranscript team to be written up, who will return the recording in as little as six hours.      According to GoTranscript CEO, Peter Trebek, the academic transcription service was created with the intention of allowing students to concentrate on the lecture and the ideas being conveyed.      “We understand that entering university can be a challenging time for many, and as a company, we hope to alleviate some of the difficulties that students face whether they be in relation to focusing on studies or increasing living costs,” he said. “As part of our corporate pledge, we are also very happy to give young people a chance to enter the job market.”      In addition to its scholarship programme, employment opportunities, and academic transcription services, GoTranscript also gives students a 20% discount on all of its services.        -      END -   ABOUT GO TRANSCRIPT   Founded in 2005, Go Transcript specialises in easy-to-use, quality-focused human-powered transcriptions delivered online around the world.

5000g000028c2o3AAA,DeCordova Awards 20th Annual Rappaport Prize to Boston-based Visual Artist Daniela Rivera,"Good morning,  DeCordova Sculpture Park and Museum announces Boston-based visual artist Daniela Rivera as the 2019 recipient of its annual Rappaport Prize<https://decordova.org/rappaport-prize>. This year marks the twentieth anniversary of the prestigious award, which is presented to a contemporary artist with strong connections to New England and a proven record of achievement.  Please see press release below and attached for more details. Images of the artist and her artwork can be downloaded here<https://www.dropbox.com/sh/lgwfber9tjpiwkp/AADiGozPocWpqJEnmsOrPVnra?dl=0>. I'd be happy to coordinate interviews, as well.  __________________________________   DeCordova Awards 20th Annual Rappaport Prize to  Boston-based Visual Artist Daniela Rivera  Boston & Lincoln, MA -- August 14, 2019 – DeCordova Sculpture Park and Museum announces Boston-based visual artist Daniela Rivera as the 2019 recipient of its annual Rappaport Prize<https://decordova.org/rappaport-prize>. This year marks the twentieth anniversary of the prestigious award, which is presented to a contemporary artist with strong connections to New England and a proven record of achievement. Established in 2000, the Rappaport Prize is one of the most generous contemporary art awards of its kind. In 2010, the Prize was endowed in perpetuity by the Phyllis and Jerome Lyle Rappaport Foundation, assuring the ongoing support of contemporary art and artists in New England. In 2019, The Rappaport Foundation made an additional gift of $500,000 in order to increase the annual award amount from $25,000 to $35,000, beginning with this year’s Prize.  “I’m delighted for deCordova to award this year’s twentieth Rappaport Prize to Daniela Rivera,” says John B. Ravenal, The Trustees’ Vice President for Arts & Culture and Artistic Director at deCordova. “She has deep ties to New England and the Boston area, and I’ve long admired her sophisticated site-specific installations with their fascinating intersection of politics, history, and perception. I can’t think of a more deserving recipient.”  Daniela Rivera (born 1973 in Santiago, Chile) is a painter and installation artist, often working with immersive architectural forms on a monumental scale. Having grown up under the Pinochet dictatorship in Chile before moving to Boston in 2002, Rivera addresses the specific history of repression that she experienced firsthand while also drawing her viewers into larger global narratives of dislocation and turmoil.  “The Rappaport Prize is an incredible honor to receive. It is such an affirming recognition of my work over the last 17 years in Massachusetts,” says Rivera. “It gives value to my experience as a U.S. and New England resident, as well as to the choices I've made and the life circumstances I've faced here. This prize also opens up so many possibilities for my work, including an opera on immigration that I have been wanting to create and can now begin planning as a result.”  The public is invited to attend the annual Rappaport Prize Lecture with Daniela Rivera on Wednesday, October 23 at 6:30PM at deCordova Sculpture Park and Museum featuring a reception with and talk by the artist.  “We are thrilled to help celebrate deCordova’s twentieth anniversary of this important award,” adds Trustees President & CEO Barbara Erickson. “We look forward to welcoming our newly combined Trustees and deCordova members and supporters to join us for Daniela’s upcoming lecture this fall.”   Program Details  The Rappaport Prize Lecture with Daniela Rivera will be held on Wednesday, October 23, in the deCordova’s Dewey Gallery. The evening will begin with a reception and cash bar at 6PM followed by the artist’s talk at 6:30PM. Event is free; space is limited, and registration is required. Please reserve tickets at decordova.org/rappaport. DeCordova Sculpture Park and Museum is located at 51 Sandy Pond Road in Lincoln, MA.   About the Artist  Daniela Rivera received her BFA from the School of Fine Arts, Pontifica Universidad Católica de Chile, Santiago (1996) and her MFA from the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (2006), and was a fellow at Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture, Maine (2006). She has been featured in solo exhibitions at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (2017); the Museo de Arte Contemporaneo, Santiago, Chile (2012); LaMontagne Gallery, Boston; and the Davis Museum, Wellesley, MA (2010). She has also been included in group exhibitions at the Institute of Contemporary Art/Boston (2010, 2011). Rivera is currently an Associate Professor of Art at Wellesley College, where she has taught since 2008.  Born the year of Augusto Pinochet’s seizure of power in Chile in 1973, Rivera’s coming-of-age was profoundly shaped by the ensuing years of military dictatorship, including the disappearance of activists and government critics. Her work is informed by the politics of repression that she experienced growing up in a dictatorship with a philosophy that the role of the artist today is to provide visibility to questions that may not yet have been asked or perhaps have been buried for a variety of reasons.  When Rivera moved to Boston in 2002, she turned from painting to sculpture and installation. Daniela Rivera: The Andes Inverted, a 2017–2018 exhibition at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, resulted from research that Rivera undertook into an evacuated mining town on the edge of Chile’s Chuquicamata copper mine. Removing a section of the museum’s pristine walls to expose the building’s inner structure and installing a monumental sculpture of the Andes, the exhibition was both productive and destructive, additive and subtractive, which is how Rivera describes the long-term social and ecological effects of mining. Exemplifying Rivera’s architectural installations, The Andes Inverted surrounded its viewers in such a way that its references to mining, labor, and dictatorship did not seem far away, but instead urgent and ever-present.   About the Rappaport Prize  Since its inception in 2000, the Rappaport Prize has been an investment in both individual artists and the broader art community. Founded and funded by the Phyllis and Jerome Lyle Rappaport Foundation, the Rappaport Prize follows the Foundation’s mission of promoting leadership in art, public policy, and medical research. Endowed at, and selected annually by, deCordova Sculpture Park and Museum, the Rappaport Prize supports artists while educating the public about developments in American contemporary art.  The prize celebrates the achievement and potential of an artist who has demonstrated significant creativity and vision, and encourages the recipient to continue a career of innovative art making. Together, deCordova and the Rappaport Foundation hope to create a community of accomplished artists whose careers have been enhanced by the recognition of the Rappaport Prize. In 2010, the Rappaport Foundation permanently endowed the prize, ensuring its continuation in perpetuity.  Each year deCordova invites art professionals from around the country—museum directors, curators, collectors, and artists—to submit nominations for the Prize based on set criteria. Each nominee is asked to meet the following criteria:    *   Produce artwork of exceptional quality   *   Demonstrate excellence and leadership in their chosen practice   *   Engage with aesthetic issues which have had a significant impact on contemporary art   *   Have a relationship to New England—whether they were born, educated, resided, or currently reside in the region.  All forms of media are considered. The Museum does not discriminate based on age, financial status, reputation, race, sexual orientation, or gender. After reviewing the nominations, as well as suggesting their own nominations, deCordova's curators and Director select the Prize winner.

5000g000028c1MSAAY,Steyer Calls Out Corporate Control of Politicians in Latest Ad,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: Wednesday, August 14, 2019 CONTACT: press@tomsteyer.com Steyer Calls Out Corporate Control of Politicians in Latest Ad In “Trust the People,” Steyer advocates for term limits and a national referendum— the first for a Democrat seeking the nomination  (SAN FRANCISCO, August 14, 2019) — Today, candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination Tom Steyer released his campaign’s latest ad “Trust the People (https://youtu.be/_9_bZ2Qmg88) ,” which highlights the stranglehold corporations have on Washington politicians. In the ad, Steyer advocates for term limits for Congress and a national referendum in order to put the power of our Democracy back in the hands of the American people.  The ad will run today through August 20 locally in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Nevada — the first four primary and caucus states.  “I trust the people, not the politicians in Washington, to fix this. As president, I’ll establish a national referendum to make your voice heard. And term limits for Congress, to ensure politicians focus more on you than getting re-elected,” Steyer said in the ad.  On Tuesday, August 13th, Steyer reached the donor requirement of 130,000 to make the September debate. He is now just one qualifying poll away from making it onto the September DNC debate stage in Houston, TX. In only a few weeks, Steyer has surpassed candidates who have been in the race much longer, in polling from Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina. Steyer has been steadily gaining traction in early primary states, as indicated by three qualifying polls in Iowa and South Carolina, the most recent of which, from Monmouth University, had the candidate polling at 3%. Other non-DNC sanctioned polls show Steyer joining the top tier of Democratic contenders. On Monday, Morning Consult (https://morningconsult.com/2020-democratic-primary/) had Steyer polling at 6% in early states, tying for fourth place with Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, and Cory Booker. A new Change Research Poll (https://tomsteyer.us3.list-manage.com/track/click?u=19050e87bef316243d0543d86&id=e214f1557f&e=bbde25d330) has Steyer at 3% in Nevada, besting Beto O’Rourke.  See below for the full script:  Our democracy is under attack. It’s been bought by corporations that put profits over people.  I’ve been taking on corporations and winning for 10 years.  I trust the people, not the politicians in Washington, to fix this.  As president, I’ll establish a national referendum to make your voice heard.  And term limits for Congress, to ensure politicians focus more on you than getting re-elected.  I’m Tom Steyer and I approve this message. Let’s make change happen.  Paid for by Tom Steyer 2020.  ###  About Tom:  Tom Steyer left his successful investing business seven years ago to give his own money and all his time and energy to fighting for progressive causes. He soon became one of the country’s leading forces in registering more young voters and voters of color, fighting climate change, working for racial justice, and helping secure better lives for all Americans. Tom has led a number of people-first, grassroots campaigns that have repeatedly defeated powerful special interests, beating big oil to win clean air laws, forcing big tobacco to pay its share of healthcare costs, and closing a billion-dollar corporate tax loophole to fund public schools.  Tom and his wife Kat Taylor were early signers of the Giving Pledge, a commitment to give the bulk of his fortune to good causes before they die. Tom’s dedication to doing what is right comes from his parents. His father was a lawyer who prosecuted Nazis at the Nuremberg Trials; his mother was a journalist and teacher who volunteered to teach prisoners in New York City jails. Tom says his parents showed him the power of having the courage to do the right thing. Their greatest lesson, he says, was that our actions speak louder than our words – what we do is more important than what we say.  ============================================================ Tom Steyer 2020 | P.O.

Peace Now Cover.jpgLevi and Orrantia traveled to Caño Indio, Colombia, to teach former guerrillas how to write: giving the tools of writing to former paramilitaries, putting the power of storytelling into their hands. Over the course of their trip, they spoke with former members of the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia, or the FARC, and military commanders alike, to give readers a lay of the post-peace landscape.  As part of the 2016 peace treaty signed by the leaders of the FARC and the Colombian government, guerrillas traded their rifles and tents for a village of adobe and zinc and running water. These Espacios Territoriales de Capacitación y Reincorporación, or ETCRs, were constructed by the Colombian government to provide safe havens and to reintegrate, into the workforce and social life of their country during the transition from war to peace. Along with the Jurisdicción Especial Para la Paz, or JEP, an independent court set up to try war crimes like murder, kidnapping, and rape by all the actors in the conflict, including the army and the government, the ETCRs are at the heart of the peace plan of former Colombian president Juan Manuel Santos, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for negotiating an end to over 50 years of civil war.  But the current president, Iván Duque, has other ideas. Although the peace plan was the result of a negotiation between the Colombian government and an armed group that was never defeated, Duque says that the deal gave the FARC too much, including amnesty and positions in Congress. And now funding is poised to run out for dozens of ETCRs around the country.

Thank you so much. What an honor to be here. Thank you, first place, to Democrats of Iowa. Thank you Pat and Chris, thank you.  I want to talk to you tonight about how we're going to beat Donald Trump. We're not going to beat him with a political argument. We're not going to meet him with an economic argument. I respect Tom Steyer, all of the things that he was saying. Tom said we're going to beat him with an economic argument. The economy will either be good or the economy will be bad. But even if the economy is good, and it's even going to be harder, or even if the economy is bad, I don't believe we're going to beat him with an economic argument. I don't even think we're going to meet him with a rational argument. We're going to meet him with a moral argument. That is how we're going to beat him.  And I'm going to tell you what that argument is, but first of all, I want to tell you why it works. I want to refer you to a story in the Bible of David and Goliath. Now, David and Goliath is obviously a biblical tale, but there have been many secular psychological books about the mythology of the story. Even the very well known writer Malcolm Gladwell wrote a book about David and Goliath.  David and Goliath In the story of David and Goliath, the greatest warriors of the Israelites were cowering, afraid. They were the greatest warriors that the nation of Israel had. And yet, Goliath was a giant. And so the warriors were afraid about the battle that was going to be happening the next morning.  Now, David was not a warrior. David was a shepherd. David was a musician. David was an artist. David took care of people and sheep. And he was there to tend to the warriors. He was there to provide them food. And seeing how afraid all of the warriors were, he said, ""I'll do it."" And they said, ""You'll do it?"" And he said, ""Yes, send me."" For those of you who know the Great Gospel tune, he said, ""Yes, send me, I will do it.""  Now, it's very interesting that king Saul, seeing that David was prepared to go into battle with Goliath, said, ""Well, the least that I can do is give you my suit of armor."" And David put it on for a moment and then he took it off. And he said, ""If I'm going to do this, I have to do it my way.""  And we know what happened. We know that Goliath was laughing. We know that all the giants were laughing at the thought that David could defeat them. But we know that David had a slingshot. Now, let's look at what David did with that slingshot. He hit Goliath in the one place where Goliath had no defense. And that is how we are going to defeat Donald Trump, in that one place where he has no defense. He has no conscience. He has no empathy. He has no ethics. He has no morals. And we're going to shoot him right in that place. And that is how we're going to do it.  Now, it has been said by quite a few Democrats that the president's policies are immoral, and I agree with that. But in every other area, that Democrats understand that it's not enough to just say what we're against. We also have to say what we're for. So on the moral argument, the same is true. We can't just say the president's policies are immoral, we have to stand for a moral politics. And that is why I'd like to present you the four pillars of my campaign, which I believe are the pillars of a moral politics.  Economy One has to do with economics, the same economics that most Democrats have, and that all progressive Democrats have. Forty years ago, we transitioned into an amoral economic capitalism, an amoral economic system, which posits that a corporation's fiduciary responsibility to its stockholders matters before and above any other moral or ethical concern and at the expense, even, of other stakeholders. So, as long as the stockholders got their money, that was all, theoretically, that the American Corporation was supposed to have to care about, even if it's at the expense of the workers. Even if it's at the expense of the community. Even if it's at the expense of the environment. And in a way, all Americans are stakeholders in what happens in corporate America.  That amoral economic system, as we well know, as every Democrat is clear about, has corrupted our government. It has corrupted our government because of the undue influence of money and it has hijacked America's value system. And that is why the politics of the Democrats have got to stand, not only for the economic argument but for the moral argument. And take a stand for justice, the moral obscenity of an economic system that does more to help the rich get richer and makes it harder for everybody else to even make it through the day.  That is a moral wrong. It is not only an economic injustice, injustice itself is moral. We want love. And where there is no justice, there is no love.  Now, the second pillar, that is why, of course, like every other Democrat, I want to repeal the 2017 tax cut. Eighty-three cents [on the dollar] given to the very richest among us and the very richest corporations. Why I want to put back in the middle-class tax cut. It's why I want to stop those subsidies. $26 billion to oil and gas in one year to the fossil fuel companies? Ladies and gentlemen, this is immoral. This is wrong. This is why we need to have the $15 an hour minimum wage, because it's immoral to make people work two and three jobs in the richest country in the world in order for them to even get a modest two-bedroom apartment.  That is why we must do all of the things that we know must be done in order to bring economic fairness to the people because it is immoral. An amoral economic system has, and always would have, immoral consequences. We stand on the moral argument.  Children Secondly, we have to look at our own house. And we have to stand for some things that, maybe, Democrats aren't always used to standing for. And that has to do with what is happening to America's children. We have millions of American children, and yes, they are here in Iowa too, who are chronically traumatized. We have millions of American children who go to school every single day in schools that don't even have the adequate school supplies with which to teach a child to read. If a child cannot learn to read by the age of eight, the chances of high school graduation are drastically diminished. The chances of incarceration are drastically increased.  Millions of these children are hungry, ladies and gentlemen. We have 43 million food-insecure people in this country. The Democrats should be saying, ""We will end poverty."" The Democrats should be saying, ""We should end... We will end hunger in America. It is the moral thing to do.""  We have elementary school students in the United States who are going to classrooms every day and asking the teacher, ""Do you have food for me to eat?"" We have millions of American children going to schools and classrooms so chronically traumatized by the violence in their homes and in their neighborhoods that psychologists tell us that they have PTSD that is no less severe than the PTSD of a returning veteran from Afghanistan and Iraq.  It's not enough that we say, ""We don't like that you put children in cages."" We have to say, ""We will not allow, either, the children who are already here in this country to be chronically neglected the way we are.” We stand up for America's children. They have nothing to keep them safe.  Reparations Third of all, our politics is we will spend up for reconciling America with our past. It is a principle of transformation. Psychological, spiritual, moral. You cannot have the future that you want, whether you're a nation or an individual unless you're willing to clean up the past. And that is why the Democratic Party should stand for more than race-based policies. We should stand for genuine atonement. We should stand for reparations. We should stand for reparative justice, not only to the descendants of slaves but also reparative measures with the Meskwaki and other Indian tribes throughout this country.  And I'll say to this president, ""Mr. President, the first thing I'm going to do when I get in that office is take down that picture of Andrew Jackson. It is an insult."" He will have nothing to say.  War Profiteering And the fourth has to do with our national security. This man, for the sake of $350 billion in an arms sale to Saudi Arabia in a way that would make our grandparents roll over in their graves, ladies and gentlemen. We are providing for the sake of that $350 billion in arms sale. We are participating through aerial support in a genocidal war. In America, we're doing this. We are participating in the genocidal war that the Saudis are prosecuting the Yemenis. Tens of thousands of people have died, including children. Where are the Democrats, ladies and gentleman? That is immoral. We stand for the moral thing to do. We will bring moral leadership back.  Winning back the Soul of America And that's how we're going to beat him, because on all those things, he will have nothing he can say. And I believe that there are people all over this country who believe that the moral core of America... And by the way, this is not just Democrats, this is not just lefties. There are people who are conservative. There are people who are liberal. There are people from every group. We have to worry not only about the big supporters of Donald Trump. Donald Trump didn't win time just because of the people who passionately supported him. He won, also, because of the people who did not vote and the people who voted for Jill Stein.  If the president wins again... If the president wins again, it will not be just because of the people so excited about Donald Trump. If he wins again... If he were to win again, it would be because of too many people not voting, and too many people voted for a third party. Ladies and gentlemen, we must give people a reason to vote for us.  If all we talk about is how qualified we are... We were qualified last time, then we lost the election. We need to be real. We need to be deep. We need to be honest. We need to talk about the fact that America's involved in passive child neglect of millions of American children. We have to talk about the fact that we have allowed our moral leadership to completely be eroded. We have to talk about the fact that there's a deep psychic underbelly regarding race, regarding native Americans. We should not be afraid of the truth. Because let me tell you something ladies and gentlemen, when we speak with conscience and we speak with genuine moral principle, you come out every time a Democrat.  Traditionally, in this country, the right side of the political spectrum has traditionally focused on issues of private morality. Abortion and so forth. But traditionally, the left side of the political spectrum spoke about issues and public morality. Tax injustice, economic injustice is a moral issue. War and peace is a moral issue. Environmental degradation, destroying our planet, what it's doing to the food, what it's doing to the topsoil, what it's doing to the farmers, what it's doing to future generations. This is a moral issue. International relations, this is a moral issue.  Over the last four decades, however, the conversation in the Democratic party, unlike the Democratic party of my years, has become so orbitized, so over-secularized, so much about external things, but not about values. And no, it's not enough to come in now and say, ""We're going to talk about values. We're going to talk about freedom. We're going to talk about values. We're going to talk about school."" No, no, no, no, no. You got to do more than talk about it. Trust me, I've got a 35-year career on this. You got to act on it. And once the Democratic party does more than talking about it, because it seems to work in new focus groups, and instead puts forth some policies which has the moral spine, we'll do more than Donald Trump. We will win the soul of this country back.  ###  ============================================================ ** (https://twitter.com/marwilliamson) ** (https://www.facebook.com/williamsonmarianne/) ** (https://www.instagram.com/mariannewilliamson/) ** (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXAMXGAP0YnBxtc8brSSbjg) ** (https://www.marianne2020.com) Copyright © 2019 Marianne Williamson for President, All rights reserved.

5000g000028bugPAAQ,Please forward to every parent and teacher you know…,"Fighting stigmas and advancing opportunities for and with people with disabilities  About RespectAbility | Solutions Center  Hello Stephanie,  I hope you are having a great summer. Personally, I just started a “stay-cation” to spend some summer days with our family. Speaking of family, I am hoping that you can share the piece below with all the parents of school aged children and teachers you know. Great teacher-parent relationships, open communications and high expectations are vital to enable students with disabilities to succeed.  On another note, the movie The Peanut Butter Falcon is opening on Friday. We featured this film at our national conference recently, showing a trailer along with a video greeting from the directors, and now it’s about to hit the theaters. It’s a fantastic film that stars Zack Gottsagen who has Down syndrome. He’s terrific and you will love the film! Don’t just take my word for it - it has a score of 96% on Rotten Tomatoes! Also, take a look at this fab piece from yesterday’s USA Today on disability employment. See HERE.  Best to you and yours! Respectfully, Jennifer Laszlo Mizrahi President, RespectAbility Tips for Parents of Children With Disabilities Who Want Them To Succeed in School By Jennifer Laszlo Mizrahi As someone with a disability myself, and who also knows what it means to parent a child with multiple disabilities, I’ve become an advocate for my children on so many fronts, including their education. After all, when it comes to disability and inclusion, despite good intentions, many schools don’t even know what they don’t know. Also, only 61% of students with disabilities get a high school degree — so it is up to people with disabilities, and their loved ones, to educate and advocate for disability inclusion and success. This is especially true when enabling children with disabilities to have full access to education. While today on average only 1-in-3 working age adults with a disability have a job, studies show that 70% of young people with disabilities can get jobs and careers. But we have to do our part. Here are some tips I’ve used in the past that may be helpful to you:  1. Know you are not alone. Fully 1-in-5 Americans has a disability. While parenting a child with differences feels lonely at times, seek out other families with similar experiences. Peers can offer good advice, and may become your new best friends. They reside in your local community and online. 2. Research which schools in your area have real experience and success working with children with disabilities. While all public schools are required to accommodate students with disabilities, some schools may have magnet programs specifically for your child’s educational needs. In other cases, you may want to resist when your school district wants to bus your child across town to a school for other kids with disabilities, when accommodations can be easily made at his or her neighborhood school.  Call your local disability groups to see what resources and leads they can offer. Ask other parents of children with disabilities about their experiences with different schools. Go online to look at the school’s website. Does it say they welcome and serve people with disabilities?  3. Write an “all about how to succeed with my child” letter. Yes, you should also prepare a file with your child’s Individualize Education Plan (IEP), including suggestions for success from any speech, physical, occupational, mental health or other therapists that works with your child. But don’t expect all teachers to be knowledgeable enough to understand some of the technical material. Your letter should be easy to read. Provide a toolkit for working with your child. Put things into simple language with bullets of information that the school needs to know to make your child’s experience safe and successful. Remember, as a parent, you have unique insights about your child that can help your child’s teacher understand his/her strengths and needs. Your candor, experience and advice will be much appreciated. Depending on the age of your child, you may want your child to help write the memo.  4. Request a meeting with your child’s teacher and team. Yes, everyone is busy. However, if you miss out on having a real substantive conversation, you may create a situation that turns your child off to school and learning. Additionally, it is not enough to meet with the school principal. You need to sit face-to-face with teacher who will be in the classroom with your child, as well as the school leaders who support that teacher. If appropriate, bring your child’s therapists. Depending on the age of your child, you may want to bring them to this meeting. Before the meeting, you should send your memo about your child to all the meeting participants. Bring copies of it to the meeting as well, and have your “elevator pitch” about your child ready to go. You may want to practice it in front of someone who can offer constructive criticism. It is important to get your points across quickly so they can ask questions. Teachers will really appreciate your efforts, resources and transparency. Once the teachers learn about your child, the school may want to put an extra aid in the classroom to support your child’s needs. Alternatively, they may want to match your child with a different teacher who is more experienced. If so, do your “elevator pitch” and Q&A with that teacher as well. The school may benefit from having your child’s occupational or physical therapist meet with them, or join the class for a day, to give the teacher some tips. 5. Ask the teacher and team about their preferred method of communication. Mutual respect and trust are important to all relationships. This includes the relationship you want to cultivate with your child’s teacher. That’s why it’s important to find out which method of communication suits them the best. Many prefer emails. 6. Be fully transparent with your child’s team. If your child has tantrums, be sure the staff understands what causes the tantrums, and how to prevent them. If your child needs notification before a transition, or has a tick or expression that they use to indicate he or she is anxious, the team needs to know, so they can best serve your child. This is not the time to worry about privacy - you need to focus on safety and success.  7. Be upbeat. Teachers want proactive parents. A positive relationship with your child’s teacher will help your child feel good about school. Before you hit “send,” look over emails, making sure they’re respectful of the teacher’s time and also of their efforts to help your child. It’s great for you to ask questions and make suggestions as long as your message conveys your trust that the teacher is performing her job ethically, responsibly and to the best of their ability. You want to be their partner. Remember that a teacher is a person first. Send thank you notes, volunteer, let them know when your child really enjoyed a particular lesson, and try to be considerate of their schedule; teachers have families too.  8. Share your enthusiasm for learning with your child. Talk with your child about they will be learning during the year, and why it is important to you. Let your child know that you have confidence in their ability to master the content, and that you believe it will be a positive part of their life. Reinforce the natural progression of the learning process that occurs over the school year. Learning skills take time and repetition. Encourage your child to be patient, attentive, and positive. 9. Slow down and take the time to do it right. Transitions are often difficult for children with disabilities. There will be a few bumps in the road. Your child will have a successful year at school in spite of difficulties. As we move into the first few weeks of school, stay calm and positive. Remember to take care of yourself. Know your limitations, and don’t be afraid to ask for help. Make sure your child has enough sleep, plenty of time to get up, eat breakfast, and get to school.  10. Familiarize yourself with the other professionals. Make an effort to find out who it is in the school who can be a resource for you and your child. Learn their roles and how best to access their help if you need them. This can include the principal, cleaning and kitchen crew, front office personnel and others who may work with kids with disabilities on a daily basis. 11. Reinforce your child’s ability to cope. Give your child a few strategies to manage a difficult situation on his or her own, but encourage your child to tell you or the teacher if problems persist. Maintain open lines of communication with the school.  12. Help your child make at least one real friend there. Arrange play dates. Try to arrange get-togethers with some of your child’s classmates during the first weeks of school to help your child establish positive social relationships with peers. Go to holiday events with other children and help facilitate actual friendships for your child. Parents of other children both with and without disabilities who are friends with your child can become your new best friends as well.  13. Listen to Your Child’s Feelings. When your child shows any anxiety about going back to school, the worst thing you can do is brush it off with a “don’t worry about it” response. Listen and be responsive to your own child and empower them to advocate for themselves as well. Show them your love. Sometimes you need to take a little step back in order to move forward.  14. Enjoy their childhood. It goes way too fast!  Read More  DON'T MISS THESE UPCOMING OPPORTUNITIES!

5000g000028bwVnAAI,Melissa Mohr / Oxford Comma,"Dear Ms. Mohr,      Thank you for your piece on the Oxford Comma.  I was in the medical field before my retirement and didn't do a lot of writing, but recently I have been doing more.

As a member of the program, you’ll be challenged to think differently about learning across your organization. You’ll be coached by Josh Bersin, along with other global HR and business leaders, on new development approaches for reimagining the power and purpose of modern learning tools and strategies. The Program will help you answer these critical questions: What is the evolving strategic role of learning in our organizations? How is technology changing learning—for individuals, teams, and organizations? How is learning key to solving the organization’s current and most critical challenges? How can formal learning initiatives support informal day-to-day learning? How can we create programs that are learner-centered? What are the technology trends that will likely impact future purchasing decisions? How can we think of ourselves as “behavior change architects”?

Summer is a peak season for family travel due to long summer breaks for kids, and it is important for families to know that all travelers are eligible for compensation in the case of flight disruptions, regardless of age.   Airport and airline strikes, including the potential British Airways strikes, may increase this number even further. During peak family travel season, air passenger rights experts at AirHelp remind travelers that the European legislation EC 261 protects all air passengers, regardless of their age.  “Despite some airlines saying differently, infants suffer from disruptions too, so of course they should receive the same compensation as adults when they experience a long delay or cancellation. As families embark on the last of this summer’s vacations, AirHelp feels it is imperative to raise awareness of the fact that children also have rights,” says Johnny Quach, AirHelp’s Chief Product Officer. “We urge all parents to not let themselves be misled and to always remember to file a claim for children if a flight disruption happens.”  Your Rights When Things Go Wrong   There are many other details that AirHelp urges travelers to understand while traveling.  1. Your family is entitled to receive food and drinks. When you are stuck at the airport waiting for your flight, the airline must provide you – and your children! - with food and refreshments. Some airlines may offer vouchers or reimburse you for any meals and essentials that you purchase during the disruption, so make sure to keep all receipts. The laws say exactly when you should be entitled to this care — it all depends on the length of your flight delay.   2. Your family is entitled to free accommodation and airport transport. During lengthy delays or cancellations where overnight accommodation is necessary, the airline must provide you and your family free accommodation as well as free transport to and from the airport. They should put you in a hotel room or rooms that are large enough to accommodate your whole family.   3. Your child is entitled to the same amount of compensation as an adult. Even if your child’s plane ticket is only a fraction of the cost of that of an adult, he or she is still entitled to the full compensation amount. The amount of compensation that you receive is dependent on the distance of your flight, and the length of the delay — NOT the amount you paid for the ticket. This means if you are flying to the EU on an EU airline and experience a disruption eligible under EC 261, everyone in your family may be able to claim up to $700 in compensation.  4. When flying with kids, they are entitled to flight compensation too. One of the most important things to remember when you are flying with a small child is that your child is entitled to flight compensation in the event of a flight disruption.   The case is pretty straight forward for children ages two and older. You have to pay for their seats, so they are equally deserving of compensation when things go wrong.   But what about flying with a lap infant? Babies often travel on their parents' laps at a reduced infant fee. When flying with an infant aged 2 years and below, most airlines will charge a fee between 10% to 15% of the adult airfare, plus taxes and an extra fee for an infant seat belt.  For years, airlines have been refusing to compensate infants, arguing that because they don't occupy a seat, there is no compensation to pay. This changed in 2017, however, when AirHelp won a lawsuit against Thomas Cook Airlines, creating a legal breakthrough in the EU.   BONUS TIPS!  · You can fly with young infants — but the age allowed varies among airlines. One question that parents often ask is if there are any restrictions to flying with young infants. While there are airlines that allow newborns as young as two days old to fly, most airlines will only allow infants who are at least 14 days old to fly.    · Even infants need a passport. For international flights, infant passports are mandatory. Always check with the airline in question before purchasing a ticket for your baby, and make sure that you have enough time to procure valid identification for your child.  · Sitting together with your child during a flight. You might think its standard practice that adults sit together with their younger children during a flight, but there isn’t currently a law in Europe that mandates it. Though, in most cases, parents can sit with their children without any additional cost.   (If you are traveling with an infant and have assigned seats, you are usually given priority boarding to help make finding and settling into your seats as easy as possible. However, some low-cost airlines will insist that at least one adult pays for a reserved seat. Only then will they allow your child to sit beside you for free — otherwise you are subject to the same seating procedure as everyone else.)   · Baby food and milk are exempt from liquid restrictions. While liquids on airlines are often subject to restrictions, this does not apply to baby food and milk. If you are traveling with a child aged under 2 years, you are allowed to bring as much food as you need for your trip. This includes baby food, milk, fruit juice, and distilled water.    · You can bring car seats and strollers for your baby. You can bring car seats and strollers for your baby on the plane without having to pay anything extra. Strollers may be brought with you as far as the gate, where the flight crew will stow it for you before you are seated. They will return the stroller after you exit the plane. Car seats, on the other hand, can be brought on board and into the cabin. They are simply safer and more comfortable for your baby than having them sit in your lap during the whole flight. However, if you do bring a car seat, you will be required to buy a seat on the plane for your baby. This often means that you have to pay the full fare instead of the infant fee, as your child will be occupying an entire seat. Be sure to inform your airline beforehand that you are bringing a car seat with you to avoid any confusion.  About AirHelp - AirHelp is the world’s largest organization specializing in air passenger rights, helping travelers get compensation for delayed or canceled flights and in instances of denied boarding. The company also takes legal and political action to support the growth and enforcement of air passenger rights worldwide.

5000g000028buYwAAI,How Following Her Heart Led One Woman to the Mafia,"Hi Stephanie,  I’d like to introduce you to Barbara Roberts, MD (http://www.thedoctorbroad.com/) .  There are people in the know who say that Dr. Roberts caused the downfall of the New England Mafia. She did this, not by killing someone, or sending someone to jail, but by keeping undisputed mob boss, Raymond Patriarca, alive, and out of prison, for about a year too long, thanks to her testimony that he was too ill to stand trial. During this time, Dr. Roberts also became the secret lover of the alleged #3 man in the New England Mafia, Louis ""Baby Shanks"" Manocchio. Along the way, she battled politics, career stereotypes, her children’s fathers, the Family Court system, public scrutiny, and even her own conscience at times. And she made it through all, proving to be the hero of her own unique journey. Her story was even featured on an episode of the Crimetown podcast (https://www.crimetownshow.com/transcripts/2017/3/5/chapter-eleven-the-doctor-broad) .  Dr. Roberts will be releasing her memoir, The Doctor Broad: A Mafia Love Story (http://www.thedoctorbroad.com./)  [Heliotrope Books, September 3, 2019].  “I wrote this book because the world has changed so much from the world I grew up in,” Dr. Roberts recently told NBC 10’s Coffee Break with Frank and Friends Facebook TV Show (https://www.facebook.com/nbc10/videos/433692753951930/) . “I wanted particularly younger women to be able to learn some lessons in how to survive adversity, how to overcome heartbreak and how to come out in the end and really have led a full and happy life.” She adds, “I don't regret following my heart instead of my head. I became a much stronger person as a result of my relationship with Louis. I also became a better doctor by taking care of Raymond, in that I put his welfare ahead of my own, even though I paid a price.”  Can I send you a copy for review or schedule an interview with Dr. Roberts?  More information on Dr. Roberts is below.  Thanks in advance for your consideration and feedback.  Have a great day,  Joelle  ------  About Barbara Hudson Roberts, MD  Barbara Hudson Roberts, MD was the first female adult cardiologist in the state of Rhode Island.

Keep a consistent sleep schedule – Make sure you wake your kids up and have them go to bed at about the same time on weeknights and weekend nights. Bedtime and wake time should not differ from day to day by more than an hour.  1. Establish a regular, relaxing bedtime routine - Make the 30 minutes before bed wind-down time. Do not let children watch TV, use electronic devices (smartphones, tablets, etc.) or exercise during this time. Instead, have them do something relaxing, such as playing with quiet toys, reading a book or listening to soothing music.  1. Create an environment in your kid’s room that is only for sleeping – This means kids’ bedrooms should be comfortable, quiet and dark. Make sure the bedroom is not too warm (keep it 74 degrees or lower), as warm temperatures interfere with sleep. It is also very important to get all technology, including TVs, cell phones, computers, tablets, etc., out of the bedroom.  1. Make sure your family is eating regular meals throughout the day and having a light snack before bed - Do not feed kids large amounts of sugar or chocolate just before bedtime.  1. Children should exercise regularly, but not too close to bedtime - The best time for kids to exercise is first thing in the morning or in the late afternoon. If possible, they should avoid strenuous physical exertion right before bedtime.  1. Let kids enjoy the sunshine in the morning – Make sure your kids have the opportunity to spend time outside every day, especially in the morning, as exposure to sunlight or bright light helps keep the body’s internal clock on track.  1. Limit your children’s light exposure in the evening, especially after dinner - Dim overhead lights and reduce the brightness of screens.  1. Avoid putting kids down for naps if they are having trouble falling asleep at bedtime - Naps are developmentally appropriate in young children, and some adolescents benefit from a short afternoon nap (30-45 minutes right after school).  1. Do not allow kids to consume caffeine after 4 p.m. or within six hours of bedtime - Caffeine has a half-life of four to six hours, which means it should still be helping you stay awake four to six hours after you take it. Consuming caffeine too close to bedtime makes it hard to fall asleep.  1. Be mindful of teenager’s unique sleep clock - If you have teenagers in the house, keep in mind that most teens’ biology will not allow them to fall asleep any earlier than 10:30 or 11 p.m. And teens need eight-10 hours of sleep per night.  As a lead researcher on sleep and fatigue in children undergoing cancer treatment and brain tumor survivors, sleep is a major focus for Dr. Crabtree’s work.  She recently spoke at a TedX Talk (https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/wf/click?upn=G62jSYfZdO-2F12d8lSllQB0EkkfiL-2FRh3yUZZj7WJzVbzG1v5ueAvGcDEjg7CeL-2F59hvzTzSL8uhD2E4tlSXEM44wyOK31sANMCn2hX0jYbPISm1zelKDUMLVJOa7GMhN7DURJiLP3-2Bz0XpButLwlkQ-3D-3D_6pchHAirW10eM8b14ZAlkZkRllITHdt0G4CIxpgEX-2FYMT-2FVtvkhkoxOwXdc140hQDKip1v9w6NG6f4yMNdzd3I0JbBoOspHl9BOjIgd0xs3pLSZqc0y-2BOjmQcgYRv5dEjGAy11E9MU4onbMFNezUkFh0ML9G1pwa7uVdKx2PgMgB94OG2yCSpKQcCcHYlCXPRLSMXs77usvEE8HWI13IfPok-2BmvURg5u8ayv5SM251iNek2YJ76RTch3IWxswKZQNZYEzd3-2Bhns4bc7-2Flb6HQORSgeryCtEDpQ-2B6EKOMBfOArpj6R31AO-2B5U5q6l7aDBR5fDkr9kTRE9LC2Ai6-2Fc5HDy-2FlZYA2UPbslmHbrDCvM-3D in Memphis on how very early school start times are detrimental to the health of teenagers as well as those around them.  Dr. Crabtree underscores how insufficient sleep in kids and adults contributes to making us overweight, sick and sluggish.   “Sleep is the third pillar of health, along with nutrition and movement, that keeps us healthy and balanced. Yet, as a society, we really undervalue the role of sleep in keeping us healthy,” said Dr. Crabtree.  ** To Speak with Dr. Crabtree, please contact Katy Hobgood Ray at 901-595-0564     ------------------------------------------------------------  # # #  St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital (https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/wf/click?upn=G62jSYfZdO-2F12d8lSllQB8pBJtPqkpprIHSF-2F92IAYo-3D_6pchHAirW10eM8b14ZAlkZkRllITHdt0G4CIxpgEX-2FYMT-2FVtvkhkoxOwXdc140hQDKip1v9w6NG6f4yMNdzd3I0JbBoOspHl9BOjIgd0xs3pLSZqc0y-2BOjmQcgYRv5dEjGAy11E9MU4onbMFNezUkFh0ML9G1pwa7uVdKx2PgMgB94OG2yCSpKQcCcHYlCXPRLSMXs77usvEE8HWI13IfNFTk7XXtMwIOuVIL6r-2B4PHCP-2FGjli-2Fep08oO07twswTsLlDZ8jn3fYMsPyqMqRgho0FKtPK38J2bk1hq6kSYzEybvl-2BL1VYwyr4RfLJkApcH5SPZoeMyEpojxAG8DKbBaRfSF58joFaHJySCTa2Z2c-3D is leading the way the world understands, treats and cures childhood cancer and other life-threatening diseases.

Vance, Shifting Political Ideologies, Hong Kong, and More","Hudson Deciphers Shifts in American Political Ideologies  The United States is in the midst of a dramatic political shift in conventional views on national security, economics, technology, and the role of government. Hudson scholars are examining these changing norms as topics like American nationalism and the convergence of domestic and foreign policy take center stage in national debates.  In particular, Hudson launched a new podcast last week, The Realignment, which will explore these changes. The podcast is hosted by two of our new Media Fellows  Saagar Enjeti [https://www.hudson.org/experts/1278-saagar-enjeti] and  Marshall Kosloff [https://www.hudson.org/experts/1279-marshall-kosloff].  In the latest episode, they interview conservative thinker and author George Will. The episode covers a wide range of issues including the role government should have in regulating technological advances, how to deal with the threat of a rising China, and whether the United States should pursue a manufacturing-based national economic strategy to confront it.

Vance.  “I think that we should consider China as our nation should have considered Nazi Germany in the mid-1930's. Only we should recognize that it’s more dangerous because it’s larger and it’s more ambitious. I think that Hitler wanted to rule Europe. I think that China wants to rule over a much larger share of the world—maybe the entire world.” – J.D.

DeMuth followed up with an Op-Ed considering the role of the nation-state in American society in the  Wall Street Journal [https://www.hudson.org/research/15197-america-s-nationalist-awakening], writing:  The American nation-state is rich, powerful and less constrained than any other, yet it is much more constrained than we have led ourselves to believe. Thinking of ourselves as a nation-state is, as Peter Thiel has observed, a means of unromantic self-knowledge. National conservatism, by directing our attention to our nation as it is—warts, wonders and all—is a means of reminding ourselves of our dependence on one another in the here and now, and of facing up to the constraints that are the sources of productive freedom.

In  an interview with Shannon Bream on Fox News [https://www.hudson.org/research/15237-consumers-may-start-to-feel-pinch-during-next-phase-of-trump-trade-war-with-china], Pillsbury considers warning signs from experts who say if the President keeps up the pressure in his trade war with China, that the country could be in a recession in three quarters.  Rob Spalding discusses how trade tensions between China and the U.S. illuminate growing tensions between two rival superpowers in  Asia Times [https://www.asiatimes.com/2019/08/article/a-battle-for-supremacy-between-china-and-the-us/]:  Early in June, Robert Spalding, a retired Air Force general who is now a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, but who was a central figure in the development of Trump’s national security strategy, gave an illuminating newspaper interview.  Asked why the US is in a trade war with China, Spalding replied: “It’s really not about trade. It’s really about what kind of world we want to live in. When you look at everything, the full scope of everything that China does, it mixes its own brand of expansive influence into its economics. And so, it’s not only the goods that we receive here, it’s the principles too.”  Spalding went on to say that what is at stake in the contest with China is American freedoms and the values on which the country was founded. More than that, the influence of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) on global affairs undermines the values that have been built into international institutions under US leadership.  Spalding’s thoughts are echoed throughout the Trump administration and even more widely in the US. The dream that economic development in the People’s Republic of China would make Beijing into a reliable “stakeholder,” and foster political reform, achieved its zenith when, backed by former President Bill Clinton, China joined the World Trade Organization on December 11, 2001.  Spalding also provides perspective on Huawei, the trade war with China, and National Security in the U.S. in  an interview with Squawk Box on CNBC [https://www.hudson.org/research/15238-the-chinese-are-not-prepared-to-make-a-trade-deal].  U.S.-Iran Conflict  Mike Doran considers Trump’s strategy with Iran in  Politico [https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/30/trump-iran-nuclear-waivers-1441065]:  Yet even some who have pushed to end the waivers acknowledge that doing so poses a real risk of military escalation. “The administration fears that if it cancels the waivers and invokes snapback, it risks escalating the military confrontation,” said Michael Doran, who penned an essay in June arguing for ending the waivers, which was circulated widely in the administration.  But, Doran said, “The question is this: Is it better for the US to start a negotiation when Iran's nuclear program is legitimate in the eyes of international law and enjoying international partnerships with Europe, Russia and China? Or is it better to start when the program is illegitimate and has no partners? The latter is obviously preferable.”  John Lee discusses why the U.S. requests help from Australia to protect tankers in Iran in  an interview on The Drum with Kathryn Robinson [https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-08-05/the-drum-monday-august-5/11385576].

Iran’s challenge to shipping in the Gulf seeks the near-term objective of sanctions relief. But its extensive arming of Hezbollah and leverage in Syria aim at subduing Israel and consolidating Iran’s position as regional hegemon.  Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty Withdrawal  In an interview on  Fox Business [https://www.hudson.org/research/15227-china-unlikely-to-make-nuclear-pact-with-us], Rebeccah Heinrichs discusses the U.S. and Russia withdrawal from the INF Treaty.  Masashi Murano considers the strategic implications of the U.S.’s withdrawal from the INF Treaty in  RealClear Defense [https://www.hudson.org/research/15213-ensuring-indo-pacific-security-post-inf]:  The strategic environment is critical for the successful deployment of U.S. defenses. The Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) Rocket Force is asymmetric compared to the U.S-Japan alliance and can take advantage of the strategic depth to ensure the survivability of many TELs. Japan and the United States have only five to six major operational air bases in the western Pacific. A strategically reasonable option is to deploy robust and adequate land-based missiles in the Southwestern island chain, including Okinawa. However, political tension over U.S. military bases in Japan jeopardizes U.S.-Japan cooperation, and China could easily divide public opinion through information warfare. These measures must be carried out after diligent diplomacy with allies.  Given these political factors, regardless of the ground-based system, the most efficient and reliable approach is to expand the role of the Japanese Self-Defense Forces’ (JSDF) offensive and defensive capabilities, seamlessly combining them with U.S. conventional and nuclear capabilities.  Great Power Competition  Nadia Schadlow discusses great power competition in  The Atlantic [https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/08/what-genesis-great-power-competition/595405/]:  The theme of great-power competition “was there from the beginning” of the process of developing the NSS, Schadlow, now a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, told me. The decision to make it central to the administration’s strategic vision won the support of the president, senior National Security Council officials, and leaders at the top national-security agencies.  “From my personal experience, [Trump] did not push back against the frame” of great-power competition, said Schadlow, who briefed the president on the NSS, when I asked whether he resisted given his desire to cultivate good relations with Russia. “While I think overall he wants to keep lines of cooperation open with all these leaders, he is realistic about the nature of their national interests.” (While the Trump administration has taken a number of tough stands against Russia, from  expelling [https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-administration-expels-60-russian-officers-shuts-seattle-consulate-in-response-to-attack-on-former-spy-in-britain/2018/03/26/8ada3d8e-30f0-11e8-8bdd-cdb33a5eef83_story.html?utm_term=.946b986ae272] Russian intelligence officers to  approving [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/josh-rogin/wp/2017/12/20/trump-administration-approves-lethal-arms-sales-to-ukraine/?utm_term=.33964a56c42a] the sale of lethal defensive weapons to Ukraine, critics would argue that Trump has gone out of his way to mollify Putin.)  …  Still, Schadlow noted that there is now more “bipartisan consensus for the necessary adjustments [in U.S.-China relations] than people think,” and that “it’s going to be hard to go back.”  In Case You Missed It  Event:  Ensuring U.S. Technological Superiority: An Update from Under Secretary Michael D.

5000g000028c050AAA,New Study: Massachusetts Ranks No. 17 in Robocall Complaints as Epidemic Rises,"Stephanie - Robocall scams are a growing epidemic and a new study shows Massachusetts ranks No. 17 among states with 119,103 robocall complaints filed in 2018.    In April 2019, there were 3.5 billion telemarketing and robocalls made to mobile phones in America. As A.I. technology expands, robocalls are expected to keep rising.  While some businesses use robocalls for legitimate purposes, an astounding 43% of all robocalls are scams.    SocialCatfish.com<https://socialcatfish.com/> today released a comprehensive study on The Rising Robocall Epidemic in America<https://socialcatfish.com/blog/how-to-stop-robocalls/#10> using the latest data from the Federal Trade Commission and Federal Communications Commission.    Here are key findings from the study:      *   5 States with the Most Robocall Complaints: California (747,829), Florida (427,404), Texas (402,316), New York (348,615) and Illinois (252,935).   *   Robocalls By Category: Scams (43.31%), Alerts and Reminders (23.49%), Payment Reminders (19.89%) and Telemarketing (13.31%).   *   Best Call-Blocking Apps: There was a 495% increase in the number of available call-blocking apps between October 2016 and March 2018 including RoboKiller, Nomorobo and Truecaller.   *   Most Common Scams: Are calls purported to be from the IRS, health insurance companies and foreign consulates.  A new scam claiming to be from the Chinese consulate has cost more than $40 million in total or $164,000 per victim.    Here are 5 practical tips to avoid being a victim of a robocall scam:      1.  Register your number with the Do Not Call List   2.  Do not respond to questions that can be answered with “yes” from unknown numbers   3.  Set up a password for your mobile voicemail to avoid being hacked   4.  Download robocall blocking apps   5.  If you receive robocalls take action and file a complaint with the FCC<https://consumercomplaints.fcc.gov/hc/en-us/articles/115002234203-Unwanted-Calls>.

I wasn't just referring to wedding cakes. Organizations that worked with state and federal governments were at risk of losing that opportunity unless they toed the line on social issues. There was little room for freedom of conscience or the tenets of your faith if they clashed with the prevailing administration's views of sexual morality, same-sex marriage, abortion, or gender.  Depending on who held power, it was easy to imagine a situation where Christian organizations would not be permitted to work with the government unless they shed their beliefs. Because that was out of the question, the result was an anti-faith bias in federal contracting.  Fortunately, we now have an administration that protects religious freedom.  President Trump has already issued an executive order regarding respect for religious freedom and conscience. Now, his administration is expanding those protections. The Department of Labor’s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) has issued a new proposed rule clarifying that religious organizations that contract with the federal government are protected. They may make business and employment decisions consistent with their beliefs without fear of sanction.  You can read the proposed rule here (https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2019-17472.pdf?mc_cid=3d6869ff27&mc_eid=[UNIQID]) . Note how it references some of the recent Supreme Court decisions protecting religious freedom and states that the government's role should be, ""to protect religious exercise - and not to impede it."" It also instructs federal agencies to construe the rule broadly, giving the highest level of protection to religious freedom.  In CAAP's press release (https://caapusa.org/2019/08/press-release-caap-praises-trump-administration-for-protecting-religious-freedom/?mc_cid=3d6869ff27&mc_eid=[UNIQID]) on the rule, we praised the Trump administration for keeping the promise to protect freedom of religion. Too many organizations were concerned that the federal government would try to coerce them into abandoning their principles, and the administration took action to fix that. As I said in the release:  ""Finally, people of faith have an assurance that they are not being pushed out of the public square and that their beliefs will be respected. Freedom of religion is the real civil rights battle of our time, and it’s good to see President Trump defend it.""  Of course, we still need to wait for the rule to become final. And we need to recognize that a future president could undo it. That's why it's important to keep working to elect politicians that recognize the importance of religious liberty.  This rule is an important step towards protecting Christianity in the public square, but there's still more work to be done. Fortunately, CAAP is ready to keep fighting for our rights!

5000g000028bv0PAAQ,"New book / family theme: SHAMED AND ASSAULTED FOR THEIR LOVE, INTERRACIAL COUPLE FLEES AN UNFORGIVING CULTURE","Stephanie? -  I thought you might be interested in checking out a complimentary review copy of this new memoir, which features a deep examination of family structures and how they impact children from two different cultures who ultimately fall in love. It's all true, and turns scary, tearful and fun.  Let me know if I can send you a copy or put you in touch with the author!:  SHAMED AND ASSAULTED FOR THEIR LOVE, INTERRACIAL COUPLE FLEES AN UNFORGIVING CULTURE  In New Memoir, Two People Shunned and Damaged by Society Must Fight Astounding Odds to Stay Together  Kirkus Reviews Praises Stealing Cinderella: How I Became an International Fugitive For Love (October 2019) as “Engrossing and Poignant”   A recent college grad who grew up the unwelcome only child of his parents' failed marriage, Mark Diehl went to South Korea with $20 in his pocket to teach English to adults in the city of Taegu, unschooled in the nuances of adapting respectfully to a foreign culture.   There he met Jennifer, the unwanted second daughter of a controlling and powerful Korean family.  Bonding deeply over similar childhood traumas, Mark and Jennifer transcended cultural divides and fell in love.  But cultural divides were not all they had to transcend.  In his new memoir Stealing Cinderella: How I Became an International Fugitive For Love, award-winning dystopian novelist Mark Diehl brings us the astounding story of what he endured to be with the woman he loves.  As their love blossomed, Mark learned that interracial romance, particularly with Americans, was vehemently condemned in South Korea.  In those times—the early 1990s—much of Korea was insular and  leery of foreigners after 5,000 years of hostile invasions.  Locals viewed him as stealing one of “their” women.  Jennifer’s parents saw him as interfering with plans to marry her well and increase the family’s societal status.  Soon both Mark and Jennifer became the targets of beatings and other vicious attempts to put an end to their relationship, first from society and then, when the parents found out, from the powerful family.  Jennifer—wickedly smart, fiercely independent—had always been a silent outlier in Korean society, reading translations of foreign classics and dreaming of a life where she had some choice.  With no money, no jobs and no support system, the two were ultimately forced to flee to Hong Kong, where their situation only became more dire. But having overcome such unthinkable circumstances to get there, and driven by the desire to stay together and build a loving home of their own, they found the strength to make it through hunger, poverty and ostracization and ultimately, to escape with their lives and love intact.  Told in the hallucinogenic style of a twenty-something falling in love for the first time, Stealing Cinderella asks its audience to consider the lengths they’re willing to go to for love and to remain true to themselves despite society’s pressures. It demonstrates how a shared experience—like surviving abusive families—can bond two people more tightly than race, religion or culture.  “I’m used to being excluded and feeling unwelcome. I’ve been a hoodlum my whole life. They want to tell me I’m stealing her? Fuck it. Okay, I’m stealing her,”  Diehl writes.  Mark and Jennifer now live in the United States, and have been married for 20 years.  Advance Praise for Stealing Cinderella: How I Became an International Fugitive For Love  “An engrossing, poignant, and often disturbing adventure loaded with historical and cultural details….  [Stealing Cinderella] combines the drama and excitement of a novel with some sociological commentary, offering both a tender love story and an eye-opening depiction of Korean values, restrictions, and strengths in the early ’90s.”  —Kirkus Reviews  “Stealing Cinderella is a thrilling, high-stakes memoir—emotionally intense, in which two memorable lovers fight against injustice and toward a satisfying conclusion.”  —Foreword Reviews  About Mark Diehl  Mark D. Diehl has been homeless in Japan, practiced law with a major multinational firm in Chicago, studied in Singapore, fled South Korea as a fugitive, and been stranded in Hong Kong.  After spending most of his youth running around with hoods and thugs, he eventually earned his doctorate in law at the University of Iowa and completed a two-year graduate workshop in creative writing at the University of Chicago.  The first book in his dystopian sci-fi trilogy Seventeen won the Maine Literary Award for Speculative Fiction and became an Amazon best-seller.  Mark currently lives with Jennifer in Cape Elizabeth, Maine.

5000g000028bseoAAA,An 8-Year-Old Just Schooled Us All On Eating For Our Best Lives,"Hi Stephanie,  Meet Ashley and Harlow Tyner, the mother and daughter CEO duo that’s making sure everyone, at every age, is eating for their best life yet.  Together, they’ve created Harlow’s Harvest<https://www.harlowsharvest.com/>, the monthly subscription box that will turn kids into a mini-chefs, nutritionists, and ecologist’s all-in-one sitting, and is STEM-influenced.  The brainchild of Harlow’s Harvest is 8-year-old Harlow Tyrner<https://www.harlowsharvest.com/about-us> and her mom Ashley. Harlow, at 8, is a self-proclaimed vegan (she decided that at the age of 2), and wanted to follow in her mom’s footsteps.  Harlow wanted to keep helping her peers and all kids learn more about eating cleaner but in a way that would inspire them to do so.  [cid:image001.jpg@01D551B9.06E72970]  In Harlow’s case, the Apple doesn’t fall far from tree.  Her mother’s company, Farmbox Direct<http://www.farmboxdirect.com/> is a door-to-door service that brings the freshest vegetables and fruits directly from organic farms. To make lives easier, Farmbox Direct also provides quick and easy recipes all on their site to use with the freshest product that would be delivered each week, saving user’s time and allowing them to maintain a healthier lifestyle.  Harlow believed her peers needed to learn young. The STEM-influenced subscription box teaches kids their way around the kitchen in an interactive way. Even for children with picky palettes, if they’re making it, chances are they’re eating it too.  You can learn more on how it works here<https://www.harlowsharvest.com/how-it-works>.  I would love for you to feature Ashley and Harlow who can issues such topics as:    •      How Ashely went from Being a Single Mother on Food Stamps to Owning and Running a Multi-Million Dollar Business- Farmbox Direct  •      The launch and importance of Harlow’s Harvest  •      They can make recipe while talking about their business and why it’s important to get started early  •      Raising Gen Z, one vegan at a time – healthy changes from home to school – snack packs and quick-change ups to get you on a healthy plan  •      What it’s like to be a child entrepreneur in 2019    Harlow’s Harvest box comes with recipe cards, a science project, background on the dish they are making, and an online game they can play connected to that month’s theme. And to keep the fun going, each month has a cool engaging theme like Harvest Kit (September) where kids learn about the different fall harvest veggies like squashes and learn about the different types of apples for baking, cooking, and eating or the Halloween Kit (October) which comes with a healthy spin for candy handouts (so they won’t feel tricked). Other months include themes like “The Ocean Kit and The France Kit"" which helps kids learn about geography, history, humanity and community. Just think- a world of fun and knowledge for only $19.99 a month.   Harlow’s Harvest also provides nutritional facts so children can learn about nutrition and go for something green instead of something sweet. The perfect thing for weekend activities and bringing the family together, it’s kid (and mom) tested and approved. Parents have the option of purchasing 1 box, a 6-month subscription, or 1-year monthly box subscription.    Thank you for your time.  I look forward to hearing back from you and working with you on great, inspiring story as we approach the back to school year.

This year marks the twentieth anniversary of the prestigious award, which is presented to a contemporary artist with strong connections to New England and a proven record of achievement.  Please see press release below and attached for more details. Images of the artist and her artwork can be downloaded here<https://www.dropbox.com/sh/lgwfber9tjpiwkp/AADiGozPocWpqJEnmsOrPVnra?dl=0>. I'd be happy to coordinate interviews, as well.  __________________________________   DeCordova Awards 20th Annual Rappaport Prize to  Boston-based Visual Artist Daniela Rivera  Boston & Lincoln, MA -- August 14, 2019 – DeCordova Sculpture Park and Museum announces Boston-based visual artist Daniela Rivera as the 2019 recipient of its annual Rappaport Prize<https://decordova.org/rappaport-prize>. This year marks the twentieth anniversary of the prestigious award, which is presented to a contemporary artist with strong connections to New England and a proven record of achievement. Established in 2000, the Rappaport Prize is one of the most generous contemporary art awards of its kind. In 2010, the Prize was endowed in perpetuity by the Phyllis and Jerome Lyle Rappaport Foundation, assuring the ongoing support of contemporary art and artists in New England. In 2019, The Rappaport Foundation made an additional gift of $500,000 in order to increase the annual award amount from $25,000 to $35,000, beginning with this year’s Prize.  “I’m delighted for deCordova to award this year’s twentieth Rappaport Prize to Daniela Rivera,” says John B. Ravenal, The Trustees’ Vice President for Arts & Culture and Artistic Director at deCordova. “She has deep ties to New England and the Boston area, and I’ve long admired her sophisticated site-specific installations with their fascinating intersection of politics, history, and perception. I can’t think of a more deserving recipient.”  Daniela Rivera (born 1973 in Santiago, Chile) is a painter and installation artist, often working with immersive architectural forms on a monumental scale. Having grown up under the Pinochet dictatorship in Chile before moving to Boston in 2002, Rivera addresses the specific history of repression that she experienced firsthand while also drawing her viewers into larger global narratives of dislocation and turmoil.  “The Rappaport Prize is an incredible honor to receive. It is such an affirming recognition of my work over the last 17 years in Massachusetts,” says Rivera. “It gives value to my experience as a U.S. and New England resident, as well as to the choices I've made and the life circumstances I've faced here. This prize also opens up so many possibilities for my work, including an opera on immigration that I have been wanting to create and can now begin planning as a result.”  The public is invited to attend the annual Rappaport Prize Lecture with Daniela Rivera on Wednesday, October 23 at 6:30PM at deCordova Sculpture Park and Museum featuring a reception with and talk by the artist.  “We are thrilled to help celebrate deCordova’s twentieth anniversary of this important award,” adds Trustees President & CEO Barbara Erickson. “We look forward to welcoming our newly combined Trustees and deCordova members and supporters to join us for Daniela’s upcoming lecture this fall.”   Program Details  The Rappaport Prize Lecture with Daniela Rivera will be held on Wednesday, October 23, in the deCordova’s Dewey Gallery. The evening will begin with a reception and cash bar at 6PM followed by the artist’s talk at 6:30PM. Event is free; space is limited, and registration is required.

About the Artist  Daniela Rivera received her BFA from the School of Fine Arts, Pontifica Universidad Católica de Chile, Santiago (1996) and her MFA from the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (2006), and was a fellow at Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture, Maine (2006). She has been featured in solo exhibitions at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (2017); the Museo de Arte Contemporaneo, Santiago, Chile (2012); LaMontagne Gallery, Boston; and the Davis Museum, Wellesley, MA (2010). She has also been included in group exhibitions at the Institute of Contemporary Art/Boston (2010, 2011). Rivera is currently an Associate Professor of Art at Wellesley College, where she has taught since 2008.  Born the year of Augusto Pinochet’s seizure of power in Chile in 1973, Rivera’s coming-of-age was profoundly shaped by the ensuing years of military dictatorship, including the disappearance of activists and government critics. Her work is informed by the politics of repression that she experienced growing up in a dictatorship with a philosophy that the role of the artist today is to provide visibility to questions that may not yet have been asked or perhaps have been buried for a variety of reasons.  When Rivera moved to Boston in 2002, she turned from painting to sculpture and installation. Daniela Rivera: The Andes Inverted, a 2017–2018 exhibition at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, resulted from research that Rivera undertook into an evacuated mining town on the edge of Chile’s Chuquicamata copper mine. Removing a section of the museum’s pristine walls to expose the building’s inner structure and installing a monumental sculpture of the Andes, the exhibition was both productive and destructive, additive and subtractive, which is how Rivera describes the long-term social and ecological effects of mining. Exemplifying Rivera’s architectural installations, The Andes Inverted surrounded its viewers in such a way that its references to mining, labor, and dictatorship did not seem far away, but instead urgent and ever-present.   About the Rappaport Prize  Since its inception in 2000, the Rappaport Prize has been an investment in both individual artists and the broader art community. Founded and funded by the Phyllis and Jerome Lyle Rappaport Foundation, the Rappaport Prize follows the Foundation’s mission of promoting leadership in art, public policy, and medical research. Endowed at, and selected annually by, deCordova Sculpture Park and Museum, the Rappaport Prize supports artists while educating the public about developments in American contemporary art.  The prize celebrates the achievement and potential of an artist who has demonstrated significant creativity and vision, and encourages the recipient to continue a career of innovative art making. Together, deCordova and the Rappaport Foundation hope to create a community of accomplished artists whose careers have been enhanced by the recognition of the Rappaport Prize. In 2010, the Rappaport Foundation permanently endowed the prize, ensuring its continuation in perpetuity.  Each year deCordova invites art professionals from around the country—museum directors, curators, collectors, and artists—to submit nominations for the Prize based on set criteria. Each nominee is asked to meet the following criteria:    *   Produce artwork of exceptional quality   *   Demonstrate excellence and leadership in their chosen practice   *   Engage with aesthetic issues which have had a significant impact on contemporary art   *   Have a relationship to New England—whether they were born, educated, resided, or currently reside in the region.  All forms of media are considered. The Museum does not discriminate based on age, financial status, reputation, race, sexual orientation, or gender. After reviewing the nominations, as well as suggesting their own nominations, deCordova's curators and Director select the Prize winner.

5000g000028bsVhAAI,Williamson Releases Disability Justice Plan,"View this email in your browser (https://mailchi.mp/marianne2020/disabilities_plan_8_13_19-250549?e=86750cd953) https://www.marianne2020.com/ FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE August 13, 2019 Patricia Ewing Communications Director Press@marianne2020.com (mailto:Press@marianne2020.com) 443-906-1495  Williamson Releases Disability Justice Plan  (August 13) - One in four Americans has a disability. We need justice and government action throughout the federal government. A Williamson administration will provide rights, dignity, and opportunity to every segment of society. That is how we unleash the true potential of this great nation. The Williamson Disability Justice Plan (https://www.marianne2020.com/issues/disability-justice) is a start.  Williamson meets with the Iowa Democrats Disability Caucus   The Williamson Plan for People with Disabilities  Disability Justice A Williamson administration will be dedicated to providing rights, dignity, and opportunity to every segment of society. That is how we unleash the true potential of this great nation.  All people deserve the support they may need to live independently, move around, care for themselves, get an education, vote, and work safely and productively. But people with disabilities are often denied these basic rights. They are often denied vital healthcare and home-based care and assistance they need to live independently. They are too often forced into institutions where they have little freedom and abuse is rampant, and they are impoverished by policies that penalize them for working and earning money.  Disabled children are often cruelly restrained, isolated, suspended and expelled for disability-related behaviors, and deprived of the attention and support they need to learn and thrive. Disabled people face high rates of sexual assault, are much more likely than non-disabled people to be killed by police officers, and are frequently disenfranchised by discriminatory laws and polling place inaccessibility. They face rampant inaccessibility and discrimination in everything from employment to transportation.  Disabled people and their families and allies have been fighting for their rights with courage and dedication for decades, but our government has often failed to listen to them. It is my strongly held belief that by addressing the needs of those with disabilities, we help not only them, but we help the rest of society as well. People with disabilities have profound lessons to teach to those who haven’t dealt with their challenges. The more we integrate them into society, the better lives we all lead, and the richer we all become.  Moreover, all of us who do not have a disability at this stage, are one illness or accident away from the potential of being disabled as well.  Consequently, it’s long past time for our government to fully commit itself to guaranteeing people of all abilities full civil rights and all the support they need to thrive.  Williamson Policies to Promote Disability Justice Disability Representation About ? of Americans have a disability, but due to rampant exclusion and prejudice Americans with disabilities have always been underrepresented in politics and governance. My administration will remedy this by making sure that people with disabilities are fairly represented in my Cabinet, and in all appointed positions. Furthermore, I will help support people with disabilities in their efforts to secure better representation in Congress, in the Judiciary, and in state and local governments. I will make sure that all my appointees are equally committed to defending the rights and serving Americans of all abilities.  Disability Integration Act People with physical disabilities who need help with daily activities -- like getting out of bed, dressing, eating, and showering -- are often pushed into nursing homes or other institutions where they can be deprived of independence and end up at high risk of being abused. During my first 100 days in office, I intend to do all I can to pass the existing, bipartisan Disability Integration Act that would remedy this injustice by requiring all healthcare insurers to cover home healthcare.  Long Term Care & Home and Community Based Services In addition to making sure that all health insurance covers home care, a Williamson Administration would extend health coverage -- including coverage for home care -- to currently uninsured Americans. My administration would also work to transition currently institutionalized people with disabilities to supported independent living.  Let Disabled People Work and Earn Wealth Disabled people need Social Security Insurance, Medicare, and Medicaid to cover their healthcare and living expenses. However, if they work and are paid more than $1,220 a month (which isn’t enough to raise a single person living on their own above the 2019 poverty line), their access to these programs is cut off. This forces many disabled people to stay poor and prevents them from taking on full-time work.  A Williamson Administration would guarantee healthcare as a right to all people and work with Congress to reform Social Security Insurance so that disabled people are not penalized for earning wages. We will raise the cap on earnings and create a smooth transition from financial dependence to true financial independence.  Additionally, many workplaces are insensitive to or even hostile to people with disabilities. Basic things like access to buildings are needed, as well as training of employers to be aware of what disabled people CAN do, and training of staff to be respectful toward those who may be different than themselves.  Make Disability Justice a Tenet of U.S Foreign Policy Disabled people face human rights violations all over the world. My administration will use America’s influence to strengthen international protections for the rights and freedoms of disabled people and to increase enforcement of those protections. Healthy disability policy will be part and parcel of all US trade deals with foreign nations and corporations. And America will not sit idly by in the face of flagrant abuses against individuals and communities with disabilities.  The Individuals with Disabilities Act Few pieces of federal legislation have had as dramatically positive an impact as the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). Society now has the ability to take better care of people with disabilities than ever before, and our sensitivity to their needs, as well as our response to the challenges that they face, should reflect the full force of our capacity to help. We are capable of helping people with disabilities better than ever before in our history.  My Administration will seek to fully fund IDEA so that students and their families and communities are well served, and so that states and localities don’t have to shoulder the full burden of these investments.  Marriage Equality Many disabled people are unable to marry the people they love and who love them -- especially if those people are non-disabled -- because if they do, they lose vital supports like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. Proponents of this existing policy claim that this is because married disabled people don’t need benefits because their spouses support them financially. This is foolish on its face. Far too many disabled people need expensive care which their partners can’t afford to pay.  The Williamson Administration will fight to ensure that disabled people are guaranteed healthcare and the financial support they need, regardless of whether they’re married.  Prevention of Abuse of People with Disabilities and Support for Disabled Abuse Survivors We need to guarantee that people with disabilities receive appropriate sex education. We need to teach some people with serious disabilities, and those who care for them, the meaning and importance of consent. We need to provide disabled people with ways to safely report abuse from family members and caregivers. And we need to make all support services for abuse survivors accessible to disabled people, and teach people who work to prevent and fight abuse and support survivors how to support disabled people. My administration will eagerly take on all of these initiatives.  Police Training In order to reduce police violence against people with disabilities, a Williamson Administration will require all police officers to be trained on how to interact with disabled people, including people with mental illnesses. Disabled people, people with mental illnesses, and their families and caregivers would be involved in drafting and providing this training curriculum.  Eliminating Disability-Based Disenfranchisement and Polling Place Accessibility People with disabilities who need guardians to assist them with household and healthcare management are denied the right to vote in many states, even if they are fully competent to do so. A Williamson Administration would advocate for the passage of laws – some national, some state and local – that would forbid this practice throughout America.  Furthermore, polling places are often inaccessible to disabled people because they are located in religious institutions which aren’t required to be accessible. And all too often, accessible machines aren’t kept in good repair and poll workers don’t know how to assist voters with disabilities.  A Williamson Administration would require polling sites to be accessible, accessible voting machines be available and kept in good condition, and poll workers to be trained to support voters with disabilities. In addition, proper, accessible transportation to and from the polls is necessary, or at the very least, assistance (where needed) in voting by mail.  In Conclusion Everyone deserves full human and civil rights protections, and all the accessibility and support they need to live and thrive. A Williamson Administration will work with disabled people and their families and caregivers to ensure that our country provide those with disabilities the respect they deserve as infinitely valuable and precious human beings. ###  ============================================================ ** (https://twitter.com/marwilliamson) ** (https://www.facebook.com/williamsonmarianne/) ** (https://www.instagram.com/mariannewilliamson/) ** (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXAMXGAP0YnBxtc8brSSbjg) ** (https://www.marianne2020.com) Copyright © 2019 Marianne Williamson for President, All rights reserved.

Psychologist warns there could be pitfalls,"Permission to use content: You may post this information as soon as you wish, provided you quote Dr. Sanam Hafeez. If you wish to conduct an interview for unique content, please e-mail: Katherine@kmrcommunications.com Dr. Hafeez is located in New York City.   Want to Work From Home?  There May Be Some Pitfalls, According To An NYC Neuropsychologist  www.comprehendthemind.com (https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/wf/click?upn=84Em28S1K9SvtzcUtu04EniBrjjfsJfZiMq9ba6gv-2BbA6bkqMTdAGWJqQqum00GC_6pchHAirW10eM8b14ZAlkZkRllITHdt0G4CIxpgEX-2FYMT-2FVtvkhkoxOwXdc140hQDKip1v9w6NG6f4yMNdzd3I0JbBoOspHl9BOjIgd0xs0LqJz-2FXVAtKcwjbqagwx412xUzXsTNsRIfBkNfgchByc5CSitM5FXHUuamD3BaBEguE85BP8ynajL23rjv0GfDn5CKSeRGuKEI1alJe008aMueOAC9H-2Bli6BB8uRe0gtyiSsReTBEbqrTfV0a-2BuF31CZ80hm6gnkO-2BVtMcLI6T-2BpS9pElUprnjMrJuSCDq3kYfaXuKTHduFwOnWsoHBqk-2BBDB7KwwU9s9vDNZC6swSV9eVdXMVwKCswRwRgJttmlA-3D  Dr. Sanam Hafeez,  NYC neuropsychologist,  points out some essential things to consider before choosing to work from home.  Image  Studies, surveys, and census information show that about 8 million Americans work from home at least part of the week.  This amount is considerably higher today than it was back in the early 2000s. This section of the workforce is expected to grow in the coming years as online resources continue catering to this setup. The improvement of internet connectivity, collaborative applications, and software, as well as the proliferation of studies showing increases in employee productivity when working from home, have contributed to the general change of mind on this work/lifestyle choice.  But is working from home for everybody? What characteristics make for a more successful remote employee? What are some of the drawbacks for individuals working at home?  Dr. Sanam Hafeez is a Neuropsychologist in NYC with a Faculty Appointment at Columbia University. She points out that “as online tools and telecommuting become more commonplace, more conversations need to be had about what characteristics and job responsibilities a team member needs to have in order to carry out their duties successfully while working from home.”  Dr. Hafeez explains that not all personalities are the same and that employees need to be assessed in order to “determine where they would, not only feel happiest but also be more productive.”  Here Is What You Should Take Into Account If You Are Thinking Of Working Remotely:  1. Isolation  Everyone who has ever had to wake up to go to work on a Monday with little sleep, low energy or a personal issue gnawing at their mind, has felt the annoyance of having to go to the office and attend a Monday meeting. This does not mean, however, that working from home is ideal for you, explains Dr. Sanam Hafeez.  “Nearly everyone will experience that feeling of wanting to stay home instead of heading into work. For the majority of people going to work adds meaning and stimulation to their day. Introverts may have an easier time acclimating to the lack of human interaction in a work-from-home situation, but for extroverts, the lack of camaraderie and the isolation they may feel at home may be an essential deterrent that leads them to opt for an on-site position,” says Dr. Hafeez. In a 2-year Standford University study on productivity and remote work, more than half of the study group felt too isolated at home and indicated their change of heart when it came to working from home 100 percent of the time.  1. Little Separation of Home and Work  Home is where the heart is. For many of us, opening the door to our house or apartment after a long day brings a feeling of calmness from the constant stimuli of the workday. “For people who consistently work at home there might be issues separating work from play, rest and family,” says Dr. Hafeez. For an organized person who can confine their work to an established workstation within the home, this might be less of an issue but for those of us who study in bed, or like to work on the dinner table or couch this presents a challenge. “Sleep Hygiene is one of the areas where this also comes to play because our bed should be for sleep and sex.  If you are scattering papers across the place you sleep and spending hours upon hours working in bed, there is no signaled change to the brain that the bed is for sleep.  Making it difficult later on to wind down,” explains Dr. Hafeez.  1. Distractions  A cardinal rule for determining whether to work at home or in the office should always be, know thyself. “This means you are being honest with yourself as to your abilities to navigate and ignore temptations and distractions on your own without the structure of an office and team environment,” says Dr. Hafeez. People who are self-disciplined tend to do well working from home because their personality is conducive to holding themselves accountable. But if you know that in the absence of a manager or co-workers you would fall victim to distractions like the TV, food, or other to-do items, then choosing to stay in office may be an important self-reflective decision you need to make for you and your career.  1. The Dependance of Family on Your Time  One problem with working at home if you have a lot of dependents or people that count on you is the perception to those around you that you are not busy. “This means that if you are at home and something comes up, even if not urgent, you may be asked to deal with it,” warns Dr. Hafeez. This is something to consider and a conversation to be had with those you care about. People who are people-pleasers may have a difficult time adhering to their work in a moment when someone they care about needs a favor. If you still decide to work from home “consider having systems in place to deal with needs that come up. Such systems might include pharmacy delivery services, food delivery and medical transport for older adults. This may help in navigating some issues,” suggests Dr. Hafeez.  1. A Decrease In Company Rapport  For those of us with an invested interest in growing within a company and investing in our career, working from home may not be the best choice in lieu of an office option. While many companies are growing off of a collaborative and entrepreneurial spirit of remote work, companies that have headquartered spaces need people present. “Presence breeds familiarity and familiarity drives rapport,” affirms Dr. Hafeez. If a big client crisis happens, the first to know are those in the office, and if you are at home, working remotely, you might lose out on the opportunity to give your input. While people who are great multitaskers may still be able to navigate these types of situations by checking in with the in-office team regularly, those who tend to stick to their to-do list and work more reactively may find themselves plateauing with the company after some time.

U.S. companies spent $160 billion on employee training and education, yet: • 58% of managers said they did not receive any management training. • 79% of people quit their job due to lack of appreciation. • 77% of organizations report they are currently experiencing a leadership gap. • Only 10% of CEOs believe their company’s leadership development initiatives have a clear business impact. • 63% of Millennials said their leadership skills were not being fully developed. To reverse this disturbing trend, “Leadership With A Servant’s Heart” is a new series of books with you in mind. They will equip the front-line, mid-level and senior-level leaders of small, medium and large organizations, and churches, with practical and proven leadership principles, strategies, facts and real-time examples with the sole purpose of creating a new and dynamic cadre of leaders. Through the subtitle for book #1 – Leading through Personal Relationships – the principle goal is to teach, coach, mentor and share the concepts of leading others by valuing and caring for them. While it is true that “Many will not remember what you say, but most will remember how you make them feel,” the readers of this book will learn the truth of this emotion and how to effect change in their respective leadership styles. When leaders value and care for those that they are entrusted to lead, their influence increases exponentially. “Leadership With A Servant’s Heart” ( https://mychristiandaily.com/?email_id=797&user_id=93437&urlpassed=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5rZXZpbndheW5lam9obnNvbi5jb20&controller=stats&action=analyse&wysija-page=1&wysijap=subscriptions ) is systematically divided into three parts, three chapters each, to emphasize the core characteristics of a servant leader – serving, inspiring and leading: Part I – The Key to Servant Leadership: Serving Others Part II – The Goal of Servant Leadership: Inspiring Others Part III – The Result of Servant Leadership: Leading Others Foreword by: Mr. Ed DeCosta, Founder of EDC University and Author of “Ascend” and “Release Your Superhero” and senior trainer/coach with The John Maxwell Team   Genres: Leadership/Christian Living/Spirituality/Personal Growth/Business/Relationships  ISBN: 978-0-9883038-5-0 /© 2019  Trade Soft cover / 280 pages / Edited by: Fresh Eyes Proofreading and Editing  Retail Price: $24.95 U.S.A. / €22.30 Euro / £19.90 U.K. / $32.70 Canada  Dimensions: 5.5” x 8.5”  Publication date: September 3, 2019 Praise for Leadership with a Servant’s Heart: “Kevin Johnson has created a valuable resource to accelerate leadership development with a Servants’ heart. His foundation of scripture supported by practical business examples, cases, and models provide a detailed guide for the growth-minded leader.”  – Nigel Adams  Owner, Adams Consulting LLC and C12 Group Chair, Washington DC Metro Region  Former Vice President, Customer Service – JetBlue Airways  “It is obvious that Kevin Johnson is a spirit-driven, kind and generous family man, servant of God and leader of men because he has lovingly crafted a book that speaks to those very traits. Quoting Kevin, “leadership is not convenient.” Being a leader and taking on a leadership role is a tremendous responsibility, and a frequent sacrifice. The characteristic of quality leadership is a gift from God and to whom much is given, much is required.”  – Joan M. Pratt, CPA  Comptroller, City of Baltimore, Maryland “Kevin Johnson is masterful in this work. The personal experiences that he shares and the case studies are inspiring and refreshing. If you desire to be a better leader and to help others maximize their leadership potential, this is a must read.”  – Reverend Dr. Miki Merritt  Past Presiding Elder of the National Association of the Church of God, W. Middlesex, Pennsylvania “This book certainly packs a punch, it is loaded with solid statistics aligned with scriptural references. Highly recommended for men and women who want to be successful leaders in any field.”  – Dr. Reg Morais  Founder, Anoint the World Ministries, Founder & Senior Pastor, Living Faith Community Church Global, Perth, Western Australia “I commend to you Kevin Johnson’s latest book, as he describes not only servant leadership theories, but provides practical applications and examples which connect the dots. As the president of a Christian university, and having served as the head of a 60,000 person federal agency (TSA), and Deputy Director of the FBI under Robert Mueller, with over 35,000 employees, I understand and appreciate the importance of those who lead with a servant’s heart.”  – Dr. John S. Pistole  President, Anderson University, Anderson, Indiana “We are all called to serve. Leaders are called to serve above and beyond all others. Pastor Kevin establishes the connection between relationships and service. Lead yourself to this book and expect to grow.”  – Dr. Steve Greene  Publisher and Executive Vice President of Charisma Media Group About the Author: As Founder and Chief Executive of The Johnson Leadership Group LLC, Kevin provides organizations, and the people who work within them, with the tools to forge effective personnel and interpersonal communication.

5000g000028c2EjAAI,U.S. Department of Labor Proposes a Rule Clarifying Civil Rights Protections for Religious Organizations,"[cid:image003.png@01D55285.F0889AB0]        News Release U.S. Department of Labor | August 14, 2019  U.S. Department of Labor Proposes a Rule Clarifying Civil Rights Protections for Religious Organizations  WASHINGTON, DC - The U.S. Department of Labor's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) announced a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking intended to clarify the civil rights protections afforded to religious organizations that contract with the federal government. The proposed rule ensures that conscience and religious freedom are given the broadest protection permitted by law. The proposed rule is currently available for public inspection<https://gcc01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.federalregister.gov%2Fpublic-inspection%2Fsearch%3Fconditions%255Bagencies%255D%255B%255D%3Dfederal-contract-compliance-programs-office%26conditions%255Bspecial_filing%255D%3D0%26conditions%255Btype%255D%255B%255D%3DPRORULE&data=02%7C01%7Cfitzgerald.edmund%40DOL.GOV%7Cc776acc186dc4e6b5ee608d720be1df9%7C75a6305472044e0c9126adab971d4aca%7C0%7C0%7C637013873221337979&sdata=CccaQJ7VdCWUcbxTqD6HYD6pIg8MLSh6AwzFVhiuMGk%3D&reserved=0> and will be published in the Federal Register tomorrow, August 15, 2019.  The proposed rule is rooted in statute, Supreme Court decisions, and Executive Orders. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 includes a critical, protective exemption for religious organizations. A similar exemption is included in Executive Order 11246 and OFCCP's regulations, which govern certain employment practices of federal contractors. Recent Supreme Court decisions * Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission, Trinity Lutheran Church v. Comer, and Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores * further address the protections afforded religious organizations and individuals under the Constitution and federal law. Executive Orders 13798, Promoting Free Speech and Religious Liberty, and 13831, Establishment of a White House Faith and Opportunity Initiative, along with U.S. Department of Justice guidance, likewise instruct federal agencies to protect religious exercise and not impede it.  In keeping with that rich history, the proposed rule would clarify that religious organizations may make employment decisions consistent with their sincerely held religious tenets and beliefs without fear of sanction by the federal government. The proposal also reaffirms employers' obligations not to discriminate on the basis of race, sex, or other protected bases and does not exempt or excuse a contractor from complying with any other requirements.  ""Today's proposed rule helps to ensure the civil rights of religious employers are protected,"" Acting U.S. Secretary of Labor Patrick Pizzella remarked. ""As people of faith with deeply held religious beliefs are making decisions on whether to participate in federal contracting, they deserve clear understanding of their obligations and protections under the law.""  Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs Director Craig Leen said, ""OFCCP is consistently looking for ways to bring clarity and certainty to federal contractors, and this proposal falls squarely within that effort. The rulemaking process allows the public opportunity to comment on the proposal and impact any potential final rule.""  Consistent with the President's policy to enforce the robust protections for religious freedom found in federal law, the proposed rule states that it should be construed to provide the broadest protection of religious exercise recognized by the Constitution and other laws, such as the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.  Comments must be submitted electronically at http://www.regulations.gov<https://gcc01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.regulations.gov&data=02%7C01%7Cfitzgerald.edmund%40DOL.GOV%7Cc776acc186dc4e6b5ee608d720be1df9%7C75a6305472044e0c9126adab971d4aca%7C0%7C0%7C637013873221337979&sdata=CqWG5G7KUv%2Bzoi1LH%2F8zaaZoSpmCqSVkOB6xuMuI%2BFQ%3D&reserved=0>, the Federal eRulemaking Portal by facsimile or mail. See the Federal Register notice for submission details. Comments must be submitted by September 16, 2019.  OFCCP is a civil rights agency in the U.S. Department of Labor. It enforces Executive Order 11246, Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974. Collectively, these laws prohibit federal contractors and subcontractors from discriminating on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, disability or status as a protected veteran. Additionally, contractors must act affirmatively to ensure equal employment opportunity in their employment processes, and they must not discriminate against applicants or employees because they inquire about, discuss, or disclose their compensation or that of others, subject to certain limitations.  The mission of the Department of Labor is to foster, promote, and develop the welfare of the wage earners, job seekers, and retirees of the United States; improve working conditions; advance opportunities for profitable employment; and assure work-related benefits and rights.  # # #  Media Contact:  Edwin Nieves, 202-693-4655, nieves.edwin@dol.gov<mailto:nieves.edwin@dol.gov>  Release Number:  19-736-NAT/BOS 2019-124  U.S. Department of Labor news materials are accessible at http://www.dol.gov<http://www.dol.gov/>.

5000g000028c26VAAQ,"FEAT/INT: “Nobody Puts Pregnancy in the Corner: Empowering Women to Understand Their Bodies""","Dear Stephanie,  Roughly four million women give birth every year according to the CDC, yet there is still a major gap in information and resources for women whose bodies are undergoing massive changes. With more national conversations (https://www.forbes.com/sites/charlesrtaylor/2019/08/07/allyson-felix-and-athleta-how-pregnancy-let-to-a-partnership/#3cf7f3746abe) emerging to empower women, it’s time to make “uncomfortable” topics about pregnancy mainstream.  “As physical therapists and mothers, we have seen and felt the lack of support women receive during pregnancy and postpartum—specifically around exercise,” say Dr. Kate Mihevc-Edwards (https://www.katemihevcedwards.com/) and Dr. Blair Green (https://www.catalystga.com/about) , co-authors of the new book Go Ahead, Stop & Pee. “There needs to be better education surrounding exercise for women during pregnancy and postpartum. Our mission is to shine light on what women should expect, how their bodies should feel, and what is normal.”  Available for interviews, Q&As, and articles, Dr. Green and Dr. Edwards can discuss:  · How your body will transform during pregnancy—from your heart, muscles and bones to your urine output and stride length · Pelvic Health: The least talked about—but most important—thing to consider both during and after having a baby · Postpartum bodies: What new mothers need to know in order to understand and care for their bodies after pregnancy · What is butt-gripping? Common postpartum changes, and why they can lead to injury if ignored · Urinary Leakage: How to retrain your body to eliminate common leakage postpartum  Please let me know if you’re interested in receiving a copy of their new book, Go Ahead, Stop & Pee and/or if you’d like to speak with Dr. Edwards and Dr. Green.

5000g000028c2EZAAY,U.S. Department of Labor Proposes a Rule Clarifying Civil Rights Protections for Religious Organizations,"[cid:image003.png@01D55285.F0889AB0]        News Release U.S. Department of Labor | August 14, 2019  U.S. Department of Labor Proposes a Rule Clarifying Civil Rights Protections for Religious Organizations  WASHINGTON, DC - The U.S. Department of Labor's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) announced a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking intended to clarify the civil rights protections afforded to religious organizations that contract with the federal government. The proposed rule ensures that conscience and religious freedom are given the broadest protection permitted by law. The proposed rule is currently available for public inspection<https://gcc01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.federalregister.gov%2Fpublic-inspection%2Fsearch%3Fconditions%255Bagencies%255D%255B%255D%3Dfederal-contract-compliance-programs-office%26conditions%255Bspecial_filing%255D%3D0%26conditions%255Btype%255D%255B%255D%3DPRORULE&data=02%7C01%7Cfitzgerald.edmund%40DOL.GOV%7Cc776acc186dc4e6b5ee608d720be1df9%7C75a6305472044e0c9126adab971d4aca%7C0%7C0%7C637013873221337979&sdata=CccaQJ7VdCWUcbxTqD6HYD6pIg8MLSh6AwzFVhiuMGk%3D&reserved=0> and will be published in the Federal Register tomorrow, August 15, 2019.  The proposed rule is rooted in statute, Supreme Court decisions, and Executive Orders. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 includes a critical, protective exemption for religious organizations. A similar exemption is included in Executive Order 11246 and OFCCP's regulations, which govern certain employment practices of federal contractors. Recent Supreme Court decisions * Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission, Trinity Lutheran Church v. Comer, and Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores * further address the protections afforded religious organizations and individuals under the Constitution and federal law. Executive Orders 13798, Promoting Free Speech and Religious Liberty, and 13831, Establishment of a White House Faith and Opportunity Initiative, along with U.S. Department of Justice guidance, likewise instruct federal agencies to protect religious exercise and not impede it.  In keeping with that rich history, the proposed rule would clarify that religious organizations may make employment decisions consistent with their sincerely held religious tenets and beliefs without fear of sanction by the federal government. The proposal also reaffirms employers' obligations not to discriminate on the basis of race, sex, or other protected bases and does not exempt or excuse a contractor from complying with any other requirements.  ""Today's proposed rule helps to ensure the civil rights of religious employers are protected,"" Acting U.S. Secretary of Labor Patrick Pizzella remarked. ""As people of faith with deeply held religious beliefs are making decisions on whether to participate in federal contracting, they deserve clear understanding of their obligations and protections under the law.""  Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs Director Craig Leen said, ""OFCCP is consistently looking for ways to bring clarity and certainty to federal contractors, and this proposal falls squarely within that effort. The rulemaking process allows the public opportunity to comment on the proposal and impact any potential final rule.""  Consistent with the President's policy to enforce the robust protections for religious freedom found in federal law, the proposed rule states that it should be construed to provide the broadest protection of religious exercise recognized by the Constitution and other laws, such as the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.

See the Federal Register notice for submission details. Comments must be submitted by September 16, 2019.  OFCCP is a civil rights agency in the U.S. Department of Labor. It enforces Executive Order 11246, Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974. Collectively, these laws prohibit federal contractors and subcontractors from discriminating on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, disability or status as a protected veteran. Additionally, contractors must act affirmatively to ensure equal employment opportunity in their employment processes, and they must not discriminate against applicants or employees because they inquire about, discuss, or disclose their compensation or that of others, subject to certain limitations.  The mission of the Department of Labor is to foster, promote, and develop the welfare of the wage earners, job seekers, and retirees of the United States; improve working conditions; advance opportunities for profitable employment; and assure work-related benefits and rights.  # # #  Media Contact:  Edwin Nieves, 202-693-4655, nieves.edwin@dol.gov<mailto:nieves.edwin@dol.gov>  Release Number:  19-736-NAT/BOS 2019-124  U.S. Department of Labor news materials are accessible at http://www.dol.gov<http://www.dol.gov/>.

Les élections partielles des conseillers municipaux ont lieu jeudi dans les 5 communes restantes.  Image  Le Togo renforce son dispositif de marquage d’armes à feu par un don en matériel du Japon  Lomé, le 14 Août 2019-  Le Ministre de la sécurité et de la protection sociale, Yark Damehane, a réceptionné ce mercredi 14 août 2019 à Lomé, des matériels de marquage d’armes à feu. C’est un don du Japon, afin d’aider le Togo à renforcer sa sécurité.  Le matériel offert au ministère de la sécurité et de la protection civile est composé de 2 unités de commandes, des compresseurs et des appareils de marquages. Le montant total des dons est estimé à 630 mille dollars environ 373 millions de FCFA financé par le gouvernement du Japon.  Le don s’inscrit dans le cadre du lancement du projet « d’assistance à la sécurité physique et gestion de stocks, marquage et destruction des armes obsolètes et leurs munitions au Togo ».  Initié par le Centre Régional des Nations Unies pour la Paix et le Désarmement en Afrique (UNREC), ce projet permettra d’accumuler les expériences dans la lutte contre la prolifération et la circulation illicites des armes légères et de petit calibre au Togo.  Le projet à terme vise à doter le Togo d’une logistique capable de mieux gérer les stocks d’armes et munitions, de procéder au marquage d’armes détenues par l’Etat et les personnes privées en vue de permettre au pays d’avoir une maitrise des flux d’armes et munitions en circulation sur le territoire.  « En dehors des armes détenues par la population civile, le marquage concernera aussi la police nationale, les corps des paramilitaires et les forces de défense » a précisé Damehame Yark, Ministre en charge de la sécurité avant d’ajouter que le marquage des armes permet de contrôler les armes, et de savoir qui en sont les détenteurs.   Rappelons que de 2014 jusqu’à ce jour 10.030 armes ont été marquées au sein de la population civile. Cependant cela n’empêche pas le Togo d’être confronté ces derniers mois à une recrudescence de braquages qui s’opèrent généralement avec des armes.  Image  En 2018, les recettes budgétaires du Togo ont augmenté de 13,4 %, classant le pays à la 2ème place dans la zone UEMOA   Lomé, le 14 Août 2019-  Le Togo a enregistré une hausse des recettes budgétaires de 13,4%, en 2018, comparativement à l’année 2017 (11,4%).  C’est ce que révèle la Banque centrale des Etats de l’Afrique de l’Ouest (BCEAO) dans son dernier rapport annuel sur l’évolution des activités économiques dans les 8 pays de l’UEMOA (Union économique et monétaire d’Afrique de l’Ouest).   Le document indique que cette progression est la deuxième plus importante au sein de la zone UEMOA, couvert par la Banque. Le Togo vient ainsi derrière le Niger (+23,5%) et devant le Burkina Faso (+12,3%), formant avec ces deux pays, le trio de tête pour cet indicateur.  La reprise des activités économiques au deuxième semestre de l’année 2018 ainsi que la gestion rigoureuse des deniers publiques par l’Office togolais des recettes (OTR) sont quelques-unes des raisons qui expliquent la bonne performance du Togo dans l’espace.  D’après la BCEAO, dans l’ensemble, les recouvrements se sont élevés à 12 832,7 milliards de FCFA (18,4% du PIB) dans l’Union, à fin décembre 2018, en hausse de 1 094,0 milliards FCFA soit 9,3%, par rapport à l'année précédente.  Malgré cette nette amélioration dans le recouvrement des recettes fiscales, l’institution sous-régionale note que le taux de pression fiscale est resté faible à 15,7% en 2018, demeurant en deçà de l'objectif communautaire de 20% au minimum, visé à l'horizon 2019.  Rappelons que l’Office togolais des recettes (OTR), chargé du recouvrement, s’est fixé pour mission, en 2019, de collecter 669 milliards FCFA en taxes et impôts. Un objectif qui, selon l’OTR, a été atteint à 48,8%, pour le premier semestre de cette année.   Image   La CCIT et Togo Invest signent un accord de partenariat pour la réalisation du projet « LOME CROISIERE »     Lomé, le 14 Août 2019-   La Chambre de commerce et d’industrie du Togo (CCIT) et Togo Invest Corporation S.A ont officialisé le mardi 13 août 2019 à Lomé un accord de partenariat pour la concrétisation du projet « LOME CROISIÈRE » initié par la CCIT.  Selon le président de la CCIT, Germain MEBA, « LOME CROISIERE » est un projet de grande envergure intégrant l’aménagement, par le dragage des lagunes, d’un espace joignant la baie de Lomé au Lac Togo, ce qui permettra aux bateaux de plaisance de naviguer sur les cours d’eau actuellement non exploités.  L’initiative comprend également la mise en place de diverses infrastructures de développement. Il s’agit notamment d’un parc technologique et d’un centre de formation universitaire. Entrent également dans ce projet, qui devrait transformer la capitale togolaise et créer naturellement des emplois, la construction d’un port sec et la création d’une zone industrielle.  « Lomé Croisière » prévoit enfin la construction d’une nouvelle ville proposant des hôtels, des quartiers résidentiels et des activités touristiques. Togo Invest Corporation S.A se chargera de l’étude de faisabilité et de l’exécution du projet comme le prévoit l’accord qu’il a signé avec la CCIT.   La concrétisation de ce projet devrait illustrer, de façon significative, l’engagement du secteur privé togolais aux côtés du gouvernement, pour la mise en œuvre du Plan national de développement du Togo (PND 2018-2022).  Pour rappel, Togo Invest Corporation S.A est une société d’Etat qui a pour mission de conduire le développement et la mise en œuvre d’investissements stratégiques par et pour l’Etat afin de créer de la valeur ajoutée pour l’économie togolaise et ses populations.  La société a été conçue comme l’un des acteurs économiques du pays, à même de nouer des partenariats publics-privé pour la réalisation de grands projets structurants devant favoriser le développement du pays..  Image   Les élections partielles des conseillers municipaux ont lieu jeudi dans les 5 communes restantes       Lomé, le 14 Août 2019-   C’est ce jeudi 15 août 2019 que les électeurs des cinq communes à savoir : OTI SUD 1, WAWA 1, AVE 2, BASSAR 4 et ZIO 4 iront aux urnes pour choisir leurs conseillers municipaux et ce conformément aux dispositions prises par le gouvernement en Conseil des ministres.  Au total, 24 listes de partis politiques et des candidats indépendants sont en lices pour ce scrutin partiel à l’issue duquel, 63 conseillers municipaux seront élus.  Ils viendront par la suite s’ajouter aux 1464 déjà confirmés par la Cour suprême le 15 juillet dernier.  La Commission électorale nationale indépendante dit avoir pris toutes les dispositions pour la réussite de ce scrutin. Son président, Tchambakou AYASSOR a dans un message émis le vœu de voir ces élections se dérouler dans le calme et la paix et appelle tous les acteurs au sens de la responsabilité. L’ensemble des opérations de vote sera sécurisé ce jeudi par la Force sécurité élection (FOSE 2019) dont le mandat est en cours.  A noter que c’est mardi 13 août qu’a pris fin les deux semaines de campagne dans les 5 communes. La campagne s’est déroulée dans le calme et dans la paix. Ce qui démontre une fois de plus la maturité des acteurs politiques et l’enracinement de la démocratie dans le pays. Tous les candidats ont pu sillonner les différentes localités pour exposer leur programme de société aux électeurs. Selon la FOSE, aucun incident n’est à déplorer.  Rappelons que le 30 juin dernier, sur les 117 communes retenues, la CENI avait reporté les élections dans 3 communes, Avé 3, Bassar 4 et Oti-Sud 1, en évoquant des raisons techniques. Par contre dans Wawa 1 et Zio 4, les électeurs ont bien voté.

5000g000028bsInAAI,LEISURE & LEGACY: Inspirational Thought Leader Shares Why Now is the Perfect Time for Self Reflection,"Good morning! I thought you might be interested in this feel-good story to wind down Summer. Inspirational thought leader Carew Papritz is on a mission to encourage self reflection and is giving sage advice on how to live a legacy life before the ""New, New Year"". He is available for an interview, to write an article, or to provide commentary on this topic.    Are you interested?   Thanks, Alyssa (866-949-6868)   LEISURE & LEGACY  Inspirational Thought Leader Shares Why Now is the Perfect Time for Personal & Professional Reflection  shutterstock_448520098(1).jpg  The sounds of summer are quite relaxing and we often find ourselves in a state of bliss listening to the birds chirping, kids laughing, & pool splashing.   Opportunities for more fresh air, sunlight, and physical activity influence our mood and overall mental health. With brain health at its peak, it is the perfect time for self reflection and figuring out how best to leave lasting impressions with the people in our lives.   Inspirational thought leader, Carew Papritz is sharing ideas on how to self reflect and prioritize family values before the chaos of September.    ""Engaging in self reflection is a mental and emotional process that can propel you towards a new direction. Whether it's focusing on family values, career goals, or personal feats, this is a time for learning, says Papritz.""  Papritz encourages people to live everyday by the central message of his award-winning book, The Legacy Letters, to go back to the basics and live a legacy life. Consciously start making steps towards where you want to be and what you want to accomplish in the coming months, or even years. The end of summer, before another fiscal year, is a good time to take a deep inner look towards one's development and continue to learn about yourself in the process.  What will your legacy be to those around you?  WAYS TO SELF REFLECT:  · Take stock of past successes and challenges · Map out high and low points  · Reflect on Relationships  · Reflect to boost Resilience · Write in a journal or read a self help book   PAPRITZ IS ON A MISSION TO ENCOURAGE SELF REFLECTION AND SHARE ADVICE ON HOW TO LIVE A LEGACY LIFE.  ABOUT CAREW PAPRITZ:  Head Shot (Carew Papritz) high res.jpgCarew Papritz, also known as The Cowboy Philosopher, is the author of the multi-award winning book The Legacy Letters. Though fictional, The Legacy Letters has won acclaim as a life lessons book for all generations, gaining the distinction of being the only book in publishing history to win awards in both fiction and non-fiction categories. A Renaissance Man in an age that lauds the specialist, The Huffington Post says Papritz ""intrigues and enlightens, charms and catalyzes change for every reader.""

In Authentic Health, Dr. Gus Vickery shares a comprehensive yet easy-to-follow program that gets to the root causes of the conditions that destroy our health—and offers expert, actionable advice to help us reclaim our good health so we may enjoy life to the max!  Please read the following press release and let me know if I may schedule an interview with Dr. Vickery, or forward a copy of his new book for a review from you. If you would like to do a feature story, I'd be happy to send JPEGs of the author and book cover. Thank you.

Post Office Box 2394 Friendswood, TX 77549 news@ascotmedianews.com ascotmedia.com 281.333.3507 Phone 800.854.2207 Fax  (This press release may be reprinted in part or entirety by any print or broadcast media outlet, or used by any means of social media sharing)  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Authentic Health: Finally, A Plan To Reclaim Our Good Health That Actually Works  **Asheville, NC, August 14, 2019** — The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates that around fifty million Americans suffer with chronic pain. Some of the biggest contributors to this crisis are weight gain, fatigue, stress, insomnia, and generally an unhealthy lifestyle. This has become a huge dilemma—not just for individuals and their families, but for society as a whole. Dr. Gus Vickery believes that rather than using a temporary fix for these symptoms, it's time we addressed what is really causing it.  In his new book, Authentic Health: The Definitive Guide to Losing Weight, Feeling Better, Mastering Stress, Sleeping Well Every Night & Enjoying a Sense of Purpose, he offers a powerful manifesto for claiming the good health that's within each of us.  Between the covers of Authentic Health lies a comprehensive program that addresses the root causes of chronic conditions that steal our health, such as obesity, diabetes, depression and anxiety, insomnia, and many others, while explaining how proper nutrition, physical activity, managing stress, sleeping well and cultivating a sense of purpose can help us reclaim the good health we were intended to enjoy.   Among the tools offered in Authentic Health are tips for:  •    Conditioning your brain to think in a way that supports your best health; •    Building the willpower to make good health decisions; •    Overcoming dysfunctional eating and promoting lifelong health; and •    Building a healthy movement routine, mastering stress, and sleeping great  Chronic conditions like type 2 diabetes and obesity are rising at disturbing rates. Meanwhile, healthcare costs are sky-rocketing, and insurance companies are increasingly cutting their coverage of available treatments and medications. Authentic Health equips individuals with the resources to reverse — and prevent altogether — chronic health conditions while showing them how simple achieving good health can be.   Author Gus Vickery, MD, is a committed family physician with extensive experience working in the medical field. He specializes in helping people with a wide array of chronic health conditions to take the actions necessary to reverse these conditions and feel their best. By providing comprehensive health assessments based on extensive biometric data and intensive personal engagement, Dr. Vickery helps his patients create detailed lifestyle and medicinal health optimization plans built around their unique needs. Dr. Vickery is also a speaker and the founder and directing physician of Vickery Family Medicine in Asheville, North Carolina. He lives in Asheville with his wife and their three children.

Excerpts from 5-star Amazon reviews:  ""Using this book's advice will enable you to turn the tables from reactive, symptomatic treatments to exchanging your long-ingrained habits for a happier, healthier lifestyle. This book has opened my eyes to totally change so many things that I once believed to be 'healthy' options ...”  ""Dr. Vickery explains how our life history resides in our bodies and causes pain, depression, anxiety, obesity or other unwelcome intrusions. He then outlines simply and gently the habits we need to change for our pain to diminish or other anomalies to resolve. … And there is so much more simple wisdom in the book, a shining example of the generosity of a doctor willing to extend his mind and heart to listen, learn and to help us do the same.”  ""Dr. Vickery has outlined a program that focuses on habit change for ultimate authentic health success. Discussing habits is what sets this book aside from many other health programs and plans. He focuses on the core important: sleep, meditation, nutrition and physical activity, ultimately holding the reader responsible to claim their health themselves through habit changes! I especially enjoyed the chapter on mastering meditation!”  ""Dr. Vickery does an excellent job clearly laying out ways to avoid the common chronic conditions that plague our society. The book is an easy read and reinforces good advice that has led me to a lower stress and healthier lifestyle. I've also found that he has a website for those interested in digging deeper into a healthy lifestyle. Check out healthshepherds.com.”  Possible discussion topics for Dr. Gus Vickery:  •    The true causes of obesity in our country, and what we can do about it •    It's not about self-control: shattering the current belief about unhealthy lifestyles •    We're blessed with so many resources today … why are we still struggling to get healthy? •    Forget how you feel today: 5 simple truths to help you live your best health, regardless of your current health context.

5000g000028c1CwAAI,POLITICO Massachusetts Playbook: ORANGE LINE DAY – DiMASI fights lobbying ban – The rise of METH in Mass.,"Stephanie Murray's must-read rundown of what's up on Beacon Hill and beyond.                Aug 14, 2019 View in browser                     By Stephanie Murray         GOOD MORNING, MASSACHUSETTS.   ORANGE LINE CARS - Gov. Charlie Baker and his top transportation officials will debut the first group of new Orange Line trains this morning at Wellington Station in Medford.  The upgraded trains are a much-needed bright spot as the state of transportation in Massachusetts continues to be a pressing problem. The last time the MBTA put new Orange Line trains on the tracks was almost 40 years ago, which is when Jimmy Carter was president.   It's been a summer of bad headlines for transportation in Massachusetts, and that's not counting the scandal unfolding within the RMV. Last week, a Green Line car derailed in Newton, marking the sixth MBTA derailment this year. Also last week, a congestion study commissioned by the governor found that rush hour traffic has worsened over the last several years. One lowlight: Peak traffic within Route 128 lasts for 14 hours a day. If you've driven in or around Boston lately, you already knew rush hour begins at 3 p.m. The big question is how to fix it.   Officials say Red Line repairs to deal with another derailment will last into the fall, and commutes should return to normal in October. The repairs come after a June derailment that paralyzed the Red Line morning commute the day it happened, and has lengthened travel time for riders since. Some MBTA lines and sections will close down on some weekends to speed-up the repair process across the system.   Have a tip, story, suggestion, birthday, anniversary, new job, or any other nugget for the Playbook? Get in touch: smurray@politico.com.  TODAY - Gov. Charlie Baker, Secretary of Transportation Stephanie Pollack and MBTA General Manager Steve Poftak introduce new Orange Line cars at Wellington Station in Medford.  Boston Mayor Marty Walsh attends a preservation celebration for the Newcastle/Saranac Apartments.   Rep. Seth Moulton campaigns in Missouri. Sen. Elizabeth Warren campaigns in Franconia, N.H. Sen. Ed Markey holds a Green New Deal town hall in New Bedford with Mayor Jon Mitchell and state Reps. Antonio Cabral, Paul Schmid and Chris Hendricks.

DATELINE BEACON HILL       - ""Former House Speaker Sal DiMasi, fighting lobbying ban, continues to dispute incriminating details from federal corruption case,"" by Steph Solis, MassLive.com: ""When former Massachusetts House Speaker Sal DiMasi gave his first post-prison interview in December, he denied wrongdoing in the federal corruption case landed him behind bars and said he wanted to put the matter behind him. Yet, that case hovers over DiMasi as he tries to appeal a ban keeping him from registering as a state lobbyist. His attorney and the commonwealth have spent the last few months discussing his 2011 conviction for steering state contracts to Cognos, a Burlington-based software company, in exchange for  kickbacks.""  - ""Mass. education official leaves post after being included on list of clergy sex abuse claims in St. Louis,"" by Danny McDonald, Boston Globe: ""An associate commissioner for the state Department of Elementary and Secondary Education has left his position after he was included on a list of 61 former Catholic priests in Missouri credibly accused of child sex abuse allegations, officials said. Keith Westrich was on a list released last month by the St. Louis Archdiocese that included ""substantiated claims of sexual abuse of a minor made against them in connection with incidents alleged to have occurred before 2003,"" Jacqueline Reis, a state education spokeswoman confirmed in an e-mail to the  Globe Tuesday. The archdiocese released the list on July 26, and Westrich was immediately placed on leave once officials learned of the allegations, Reis said.""  - ""Vineyard Wind review could extend into 2020,"" by Colin A. Young, State House News Service: ""WITH A CRITICAL permit for the Vineyard Wind project on hold so the federal government can launch a new study of the burgeoning offshore wind industry and its potential consequences, the agency conducting that study said Tuesday its review could stretch into 2020. The US Department of the Interior's Bureau of Ocean Energy Management on Tuesday put more detail to a plan it first announced Friday, when it sent shockwaves through the industry with its plan to hold off on developing the final environmental impact statement for Vineyard Wind while it studies the wider impacts of an offshore wind  industry that is hoping to quickly ramp up along the Northeast and mid-Atlantic coastline.""  - ""Baker And Pence Discussed Trade Deal In Nantucket,"" by Colin A. Young, State House News Service: ""Shortly after Vice President Mike Pence touched down on Nantucket last weekend, he and Gov. Charlie Baker had a conversation about the trade deal the Trump administration negotiated with Mexico and Canada. The governor greeted Pence on Saturday morning at Nantucket Memorial Airport when the vice president and former governor of Indiana arrived to attend a fundraiser. Baker's office said the two talked about the stalled Vineyard Wind project and the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).          FROM THE HUB       - ""Boston Council revisits safe injection sites amid tensions over South End sweep,"" by Milton J. Valencia, Boston Globe: ""A week after tensions over open drug use and disorderly conduct boiled over in a South End neighborhood, city councilors revisited the potential for safe injections sites in Boston, even as many municipal and state officials remain skeptical of the idea. Councilor Annissa Essaibi-George, chair of the council's committee on homelessness, mental health, and recovery, said she plans to tour an injection site in Toronto in two weeks while researching the type of recovery services that city offers. Essaibi-George added, however, that a similar trip to Vancouver last year  left her with concerns that the city was offering few recovery services in favor of a place to safely inject heroin.""  - ""Meth has finally taken hold in Massachusetts,"" by Felice J. Freyer, Boston Globe: ""Methamphetamine, an illegal drug that has long plagued the West and Midwest, has finally taken hold in Massachusetts, posing a daunting new challenge to a state still grappling with the opioid crisis. Meth caught the public eye last week when it was blamed for aggressive behavior by street drug users in the South End. But the effects of methamphetamine, which has become increasingly popular in Massachusetts over the past year or two, go beyond the annoyances caused by users bathing in public fountains or congregating in front of restaurants. Meth is a body-revving stimulant like cocaine, but its effects  last longer and can be at least as addictive. Those who fall into its clutches suffer persistent physical and mental damage, and face huge hurdles if they want to break free of it.""         ON THE STUMP       - ""GOP challenger Weld denounces Trump's 'pathetic' boasting in El Paso,"" by Kadia Tubman, Yahoo News: ""Bill Weld, a former Massachusetts governor and now a Republican presidential candidate, called President Trump ""pathetic"" for bragging about crowd sizes while visiting victims and medical staff at a hospital in El Paso, Texas, after a mass shooting left 22 dead and dozens injured. ""He went out, as he should have, to the sites of the shootings and he said, 'Boy, you should have seen the respect that was paid to the office of the president of the United States. People were really looking up to me because I came and visited these people in the hospital.' He has to hear that praise. If he  doesn't hear it from the people sitting in the table around him, he'll praise himself,"" Weld said.""         DAY IN COURT       - ""State's Highest Court Reverses Itself, Reinstating Pay For Mass. Judge Accused Of Helping Immigrant Evade ICE Arrest,"" by Shannon Dooling, WBUR: ""A suspended Newton district court judge accused of helping an undocumented immigrant evade arrest at a courthouse will now be paid after a decision issued Tuesday by the state's Supreme Judicial Court. The ruling essentially reverses the SJC's original order issued the same day as the judge's indictment. It is unclear whether Joseph's $181,000 salary is guaranteed for the duration of her trial, as the court order leaves further notice up to the discretion of the SJC. Judge Shelley Joseph was charged by federal prosecutors with obstruction of  justice on April 25. Later that day, the SJC announced Joseph was suspended without pay from her position on the bench.""  - ""Judge denies Healey's motion to quash cops' testimony in gun suit,"" by Andrew Martinez, Boston Herald: ""A federal judge has denied Attorney General Maura Healey's motion to quash testimony from local police departments in a firearms lawsuit, a ruling an attorney for the gun retailers suing over her so-called copycat assault rifle ban praised. ""It's a positive sign that the stalling and delaying tactics of the attorney general have been put aside and the case can move forward,"" said Lawrence Keane, general counsel for the National Shooting Sports Foundation.""         WARREN REPORT       - ""Police group blasts Warren over Ferguson comments,"" by Sarah Betancourt, CommonWealth Magazine: ""ELIZABETH WARREN IS IN HOT WATER over a comment marking the fifth anniversary of the Ferguson, Missouri, police shooting of Michael Brown. Warren tweeted that Officer Darren Wilson ""murdered"" the 18-year-old black man in 2014. The state's largest police association quickly voiced its displeasure, the second time in just over a year that the organization has ripped the state's senior US senator over a comment related to the criminal justice system.""         ABOVE THE FOLD       - Herald: ""LIZ CROSSES BLUE LINE ... AGAIN!"" - Globe: ""Amid Mass. opioid crisis, meth moving in,"" ""Trump puts off new levies on China,"" ""RECIPE FOR HAPPY CAMPERS: TEACH THEM HOW TO COOK.""         NO PLACE LIKE THE CITY OF HOMES       - ""The Smith and Wesson calling for assault weapons ban are not the iconic Springfield gun maker,"" by Jim Kinney, Springfield Republican: ""Smith and Wesson are calling on their state and federal representatives to ban military-style assault rifles in the wake of recent shootings in Texas and in Ohio. But this Smith and Wesson - Los Angeles City Council members Greig Smith and Herb J. Wesson Jr. - share only their names with the famous Springfield gun maker and its founders: Horace Smith and Daniel B. Wesson. LA television station CBS Los Angeles reported on the councilors initiative, and noted the irony.""         THE LOCAL ANGLE       - ""It's code red for EEE in nine communities south of Boston,"" by Johanna Seltz, Boston Globe: ""There will be no more evening concerts on the lawn at Middleborough Town Hall this summer - forget about hearing the Vegas Valentinos - and all outdoor activities, including youth football, have been canceled in Carver from dusk to dawn. Similar restrictions are in place throughout Southeastern Massachusetts until the first frost eliminates the danger of contracting the dangerous mosquito-borne disease Eastern equine encephalitis in what state officials are calling a ""really bad year"" for the disease. The virus had been found in 232 mosquito pools tested south of Boston as of Aug. 12, and the  state Department of Public Health has designated nine communities as ""critical areas"" where people are most at risk: Acushnet, Carver, Freetown, Lakeville, Marion, Middleborough, northeastern New Bedford, Rochester, and Wareham.""

Psychologist warns of many pitfalls,"Permission to use content: You may post this information as soon as you wish, provided you quote Dr. Sanam Hafeez. If you wish to conduct an interview for unique content, please e-mail: Katherine@kmrcommunications.com Dr. Hafeez is located in New York City.   Want to Work From Home?  There May Be Some Pitfalls, According To An NYC Neuropsychologist  www.comprehendthemind.com (https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/wf/click?upn=84Em28S1K9SvtzcUtu04EniBrjjfsJfZiMq9ba6gv-2BbA6bkqMTdAGWJqQqum00GC_6pchHAirW10eM8b14ZAlkZkRllITHdt0G4CIxpgEX-2FYMT-2FVtvkhkoxOwXdc140hQDKip1v9w6NG6f4yMNdzd3I0JbBoOspHl9BOjIgd0xs1PB4Ukv6ErwPxHRaODoGjoLH3NxLbLcYwdsPk-2Fx9GMvumch1OpJJM1b5qO9A2Im0PKCrSinWLD4m1LIiUDeevJwOg22gcmunS92L6sYgHrfLAEh3Ag0hUNAdUYZ8ZJMdoP-2FuioBMMqH4SyN3QRRJgK-2FXG7Zib8fDHNxHMLCVABm51RY3cM17uaZcMJtfxE1JXoocduurnCujn2W1YL1-2BLPvhtFYJyOOwf3TTrkZf2UjHYIdOaMIiERMPiHsv6QZiI-3D  Dr. Sanam Hafeez,  NYC neuropsychologist,  points out some essential things to consider before choosing to work from home.  Image  Studies, surveys, and census information show that about 8 million Americans work from home at least part of the week.  This amount is considerably higher today than it was back in the early 2000s. This section of the workforce is expected to grow in the coming years as online resources continue catering to this setup. The improvement of internet connectivity, collaborative applications, and software, as well as the proliferation of studies showing increases in employee productivity when working from home, have contributed to the general change of mind on this work/lifestyle choice.  But is working from home for everybody? What characteristics make for a more successful remote employee? What are some of the drawbacks for individuals working at home?  Dr. Sanam Hafeez is a Neuropsychologist in NYC with a Faculty Appointment at Columbia University. She points out that “as online tools and telecommuting become more commonplace, more conversations need to be had about what characteristics and job responsibilities a team member needs to have in order to carry out their duties successfully while working from home.”  Dr. Hafeez explains that not all personalities are the same and that employees need to be assessed in order to “determine where they would, not only feel happiest but also be more productive.”  Here Is What You Should Take Into Account If You Are Thinking Of Working Remotely:  1. Isolation  Everyone who has ever had to wake up to go to work on a Monday with little sleep, low energy or a personal issue gnawing at their mind, has felt the annoyance of having to go to the office and attend a Monday meeting. This does not mean, however, that working from home is ideal for you, explains Dr. Sanam Hafeez.  “Nearly everyone will experience that feeling of wanting to stay home instead of heading into work. For the majority of people going to work adds meaning and stimulation to their day. Introverts may have an easier time acclimating to the lack of human interaction in a work-from-home situation, but for extroverts, the lack of camaraderie and the isolation they may feel at home may be an essential deterrent that leads them to opt for an on-site position,” says Dr. Hafeez. In a 2-year Standford University study on productivity and remote work, more than half of the study group felt too isolated at home and indicated their change of heart when it came to working from home 100 percent of the time.  1. Little Separation of Home and Work  Home is where the heart is. For many of us, opening the door to our house or apartment after a long day brings a feeling of calmness from the constant stimuli of the workday. “For people who consistently work at home there might be issues separating work from play, rest and family,” says Dr. Hafeez. For an organized person who can confine their work to an established workstation within the home, this might be less of an issue but for those of us who study in bed, or like to work on the dinner table or couch this presents a challenge. “Sleep Hygiene is one of the areas where this also comes to play because our bed should be for sleep and sex.  If you are scattering papers across the place you sleep and spending hours upon hours working in bed, there is no signaled change to the brain that the bed is for sleep.  Making it difficult later on to wind down,” explains Dr. Hafeez.  1. Distractions  A cardinal rule for determining whether to work at home or in the office should always be, know thyself. “This means you are being honest with yourself as to your abilities to navigate and ignore temptations and distractions on your own without the structure of an office and team environment,” says Dr. Hafeez. People who are self-disciplined tend to do well working from home because their personality is conducive to holding themselves accountable. But if you know that in the absence of a manager or co-workers you would fall victim to distractions like the TV, food, or other to-do items, then choosing to stay in office may be an important self-reflective decision you need to make for you and your career.  1. The Dependance of Family on Your Time  One problem with working at home if you have a lot of dependents or people that count on you is the perception to those around you that you are not busy. “This means that if you are at home and something comes up, even if not urgent, you may be asked to deal with it,” warns Dr. Hafeez. This is something to consider and a conversation to be had with those you care about. People who are people-pleasers may have a difficult time adhering to their work in a moment when someone they care about needs a favor. If you still decide to work from home “consider having systems in place to deal with needs that come up. Such systems might include pharmacy delivery services, food delivery and medical transport for older adults. This may help in navigating some issues,” suggests Dr. Hafeez.  1. A Decrease In Company Rapport  For those of us with an invested interest in growing within a company and investing in our career, working from home may not be the best choice in lieu of an office option. While many companies are growing off of a collaborative and entrepreneurial spirit of remote work, companies that have headquartered spaces need people present. “Presence breeds familiarity and familiarity drives rapport,” affirms Dr. Hafeez. If a big client crisis happens, the first to know are those in the office, and if you are at home, working remotely, you might lose out on the opportunity to give your input. While people who are great multitaskers may still be able to navigate these types of situations by checking in with the in-office team regularly, those who tend to stick to their to-do list and work more reactively may find themselves plateauing with the company after some time.

5000g000028c6S1AAI,Editorial comments and corrections,"The following information was collected:  Name: A Watertown Boring elderly  Email: so.boring.daily.basis@aol.net  Subscriber: No  Subject: Loneliness is major contributing factor of Alzheimer’s disease  Product: csmonitor.com  Message: Loneliness is major contributing factor of Alzheimer’s disease Aug 14, 2019 Obesity has become a major public health concern, affecting more than a third of adults in the United States. New research, however, suggests that there are two bigger threats: loneliness and social isolation. A new meta-analyses from Brigham Young University in Provo, UT, reveal that loneliness and social isolation may increase the risk of Alzheimer’s disease by up to 47 percent. While loneliness and social isolation are often used interchangeably, there are notable differences between the two. Social isolation is defined as a lack of contact with other individuals, while loneliness is the feeling that one is emotionally disconnected from others. In essence, a person can be in the presence of others and still feel lonely. According to a survey from the AARP, around 35 percent of adults aged 50 and older can be categorized as lonely. Loneliness and social isolation have both been associated with poor health. One study reported by Medical News Today last year, for example, suggested that loneliness may be linked to Alzheimer's disease, while other research linked social isolation to reduced survival for breast cancer patients. For this latest research, Prof. Holt-Lunstad and team sought to determine how loneliness and social isolation influence the risk of early death. The researchers came to their findings by conducting two meta-analyses of studies that looked at the link between loneliness, social isolation, and mortality. The meta-analysis included more than 3.4 million adults. The data from the first meta-analysis revealed found that loneliness, social isolation, and living alone were all associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease What is more, the team found that the risk of early death associated with loneliness, social isolation, and living alone was equal to or greater than the premature death risk associated with obesity and other major health conditions. ""There is robust evidence that social isolation and loneliness significantly increase risk for premature mortality, and the magnitude of the risk exceeds that of many leading health indicators."" Prof. Holt-Lunstad notes that these results are particularly concerning given that the aging population is increasing. ""Indeed, many nations around the world now suggest we are facing a 'loneliness epidemic,'"" she adds. ""The challenge we face now is what can be done about it.""",8/14/2019 0:00,,,Junk,,,FALSE

5000g000028bxG0AAI,What are you trusting God for?,"Practical Principles to Maximize your Kingdom Impact  Trust God for a bigger Kingdom impact? In ""What are you trusting God for?"" Gregg Hinzelman explores eight practical principles from Scripture that can allow every believer to have God-honouring impact that is ""exceeding, abundantly beyond all we can ask or imagine.""  ""I read this book with 35 years of ministry experience behind me. Upon completing only the first chapter, my vision for what God could do through me was already greatly renewed. As I continued through the book, I became increasingly convinced that every Christian, especially those in full time ministry, could greatly benefit from reading and applying the principles it explains. If you wish to leave behind the status quo and see God work through you in a way that may far exceed anything you thought, this book could make a substantial difference. When I finished, I was so inspired and impressed, that I ordered 200 copies to give away to my ministry supporters and those people I serve.""

Gorton that the lawsuit filed by sororities and fraternities against Harvard University’s policy on single-gender clubs may proceed, Erin Hawley, Senior Counsel for Independent Women’s Forum’s (IWF) Center for Law and Liberty issued the following statement:  “Independent Women’s Forum agrees with Judge Gorton that the court cannot determine whether Harvard committed intentional discrimination in violation of Title IX until the record is fully developed in discovery. IWF finds it ironic, however, that two women’s sororities--the groups most severely harmed by Harvard’s policy--were dismissed from the lawsuit because they no longer have active Harvard chapters and, thus, lack standing. The reason that these sororities no longer have active chapters, of course, is because of Harvard’s policy.”   In 2016, Harvard announced that, beginning with the Class of 2021 (the freshman class of 2017), students who join a single-sex club will be barred from campus leadership positions (such as captain of a varsity athletic team) and will not receive a college endorsement for fellowships or scholarships (such as the Rhodes). Several sororities and fraternities, as well as individual students, filed lawsuits in federal and state court last year to bar Harvard from enforcing the sanctions policy. The lawsuits argue that the policies violate Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 and basic constitutional right to freedom of association.   IWF’s 501(c)4 sister organization, Independent Women’s Voice, opposes Harvard’s policy and supports the Collegiate Freedom of Association Act (H.R. 3128), which would create statutory protection for freedom of association students on college campuses. The Collegiate Freedom of Association Act, introduced by Representative Ruben Gallego (D) and cosponsored by a bipartisan group of members in the House of Representatives, would protect women at Harvard by eliminating these unfair sanctions and would rightly defend all students’ right to associate freely.   ###  www.iwf.org (https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/wf/click?upn=9V8GzPdFA5qN-2FNwRBAx7QKDJJ8DkytrQaOoQutHbpxs-3D_6pchHAirW10eM8b14ZAlkZkRllITHdt0G4CIxpgEX-2FYMT-2FVtvkhkoxOwXdc140hQDKip1v9w6NG6f4yMNdzd3I0JbBoOspHl9BOjIgd0xs09wZeePt0JdMAC3hEloHhPajXeh708ieOX4u7sRiqav5GHZRqAVZNKEvPYmLGl0GsAw1pyMFPAEkUkO287rXAoXq-2FBTd1gixerzHPSHwumb4Orye-2FkMK2naDGgMkfI46nv7ML7Pjq7LIUdcTTjLSzOK5hH5bRxhXoHqoYCFIrQZX1GnCcYJdtO-2B84ETYm2plw8nR52i0kk7zi9X6AztFL1ddYuA0fUiM3jExnZLIfMYJ-2FSEnqNDXTBF9TCAWu3XbU-3D  Independent Women's Forum is dedicated to developing and advancing policies that aren’t just well intended, but actually enhance people’s freedom, choices, and opportunities.      ______________________  If you would rather not receive future communications from Independent Women's Forum, please go to https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/wf/click?upn=WJGmpXU-2FtyBJ1uJxb4yEYjxx4No101MjvUF8BMLR43YJ3XaIRpJpoZSMAmTKkASqIZk1RG9I6jxj8GMBnzAYT5-2BVyvXZUQvPzWPNXpXwRB6AaDsWci656pm3IXC2wgGIX4nPw4OQ1EZpXO2k2YNfeCz4Ezi8WP2tykjp4ac2PTk-3D_6pchHAirW10eM8b14ZAlkZkRllITHdt0G4CIxpgEX-2FYMT-2FVtvkhkoxOwXdc140hQDKip1v9w6NG6f4yMNdzd3I0JbBoOspHl9BOjIgd0xs09wZeePt0JdMAC3hEloHhPajXeh708ieOX4u7sRiqav5GHZRqAVZNKEvPYmLGl0GsAw1pyMFPAEkUkO287rXAoXq-2FBTd1gixerzHPSHwumb47LRXCEVV5Cn0vl87h-2B2fjqJo9N-2FTx-2FQXrEAl-2FPqpaqOrmIl9mo-2BGUBJ-2FxxonxVQvOWZ-2FErPgdV3j3IGnkuSMTyIoWdSOIkIp5kXKnfX58a2nBkja5ZXJgAxS2t8dOmOpwppPkvq0vcOtmTPDwpQgU-3D  Independent Women's Forum, 1875 I St. NW Suite 500, Washington, DC 20006 United States  --  To unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to customerservice+unsubscribe@csps.com.",8/13/2019 0:00,,,Junk,,,FALSE

5000g000028cH6TAAU,Steyer is First Candidate to Sign 350.org Day One Pledge,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: Thursday, August 15, 2019 CONTACT: press@tomsteyer.com Steyer is First Candidate to Sign 350.org (https://350action.org/day-one-pledge/) Day One Pledge  (SAN FRANCISCO, August 15, 2019) — Today, Tom Steyer was the first presidential candidate to sign the 350.org (https://350action.org/day-one-pledge/) Day One Pledge, which helps turn the page on Trump's disastrous environmental policy by taking on the fossil fuel industry. In taking the pledge, Steyer will reject new federal fossil fuel permits; phase out drilling and fracking on our public lands, coasts, and offshore; call on Congress to investigate the fossil fuel industry for misleading the public; stop drilling in the Alaskan National Wildlife Refuge; and rejoin the Paris Climate Accord.  In addition to signing the Day One Pledge, Steyer also signed the NoKXL Pledge (https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/tell-the-democratic-party-candidates-take-the-nokxl-pledge) , vowing to take executive action on day one of his presidency to stop any construction on the Keystone XL pipeline and revoke the existing permits issued by Donald Trump for the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines.  “On my first day in office, I will declare the climate crisis a national emergency and take the bold action needed to end the fossil fuel industry's stranglehold on our country,” Steyer said. ""This pledge is part of my commitment to move us towards a regenerative economy on day one to create good jobs and invest in our communities for the long term. I'm proud to be the first candidate to sign it, and I guarantee the net result will be more good-paying jobs.""  In 2013, Steyer was an early opponent of the Keystone XL Pipeline, and wrote an open letter to President Obama urging him to reject it.  Earlier this month, Steyer released a comprehensive framework (https://www.tomsteyer.com/climate-plan-framework/) for his Justice-Centered Climate Plan in which he pledged to declare the climate crisis a national emergency on day one of his presidency. In his plan, Steyer vows to treat climate change as a crisis as big and urgent as any other crisis that the country has faced, and outlines a plan rooted in social justice to protect low-income communities, fossil fuel workers, and communities of color. Steyer’s plan prioritizes people over polluting corporations, creates millions of union jobs, and builds a more sustainable, inclusive, and prosperous future for all Americans. The five pillars of his plan include: applying justice-based pollution reduction targets and actions, forming a people powered economy with grassroots planning and a Civilian Climate Corps, transforming the extraction economy into a regenerative economy with fair wages and employment, implementing climate-smart infrastructure and fair labor, and creating a climate-secure America with resilience to disasters and protecting our national security.  Paid for by Tom Steyer 2020.  ###  About Tom:  Tom Steyer left his successful investing business seven years ago to give his own money and all his time and energy to fighting for progressive causes. He soon became one of the country’s leading forces in registering more young voters and voters of color, fighting climate change, working for racial justice, and helping secure better lives for all Americans. Tom has led a number of people-first, grassroots campaigns that have repeatedly defeated powerful special interests, beating big oil to win clean air laws, forcing big tobacco to pay its share of healthcare costs, and closing a billion-dollar corporate tax loophole to fund public schools.  Tom and his wife Kat Taylor were early signers of the Giving Pledge, a commitment to give the bulk of his fortune to good causes before they die. Tom’s dedication to doing what is right comes from his parents. His father was a lawyer who prosecuted Nazis at the Nuremberg Trials; his mother was a journalist and teacher who volunteered to teach prisoners in New York City jails. Tom says his parents showed him the power of having the courage to do the right thing. Their greatest lesson, he says, was that our actions speak louder than our words – what we do is more important than what we say.  ============================================================ Tom Steyer 2020 | P.O.

Image   En 7 ans, la Politique nationale de développement à la base a nécessité pour sa réalisation 92 milliards de FCFA  Lomé, le 12 Août 2019-  Le Ministère du développement à la base a organisé le vendredi 9 août 2019 à Lomé, un atelier de validation des résultats de l’étude d’évaluation à mi-parcours de la Politique nationale de développement à la base (PNDB).  La rencontre présidée par la Ministre du développement à la base, Victoire Tomegah Dogbé, a réuni une centaine d’acteurs issus des ministères sectoriels, des partenaires de la société civile et du secteur privé.  L’objectif était de leur présenter les résultats de l’étude réalisée avec le concours du Programme des Nations Unies pour le développement(PNUD). Mais aussi de tirer les enseignements de la mise en œuvre de cette politique, dans le but de répondre aux problèmes et priorités des communautés à la base, ceci dans la dynamique des nouvelles orientations stratégiques du PND.  Au terme de cette étude, il en ressort un bilan satisfaisant et des avancées concrètes obtenues dans chacune des 04 composantes du PNDB. Ainsi, plus de 5530 comités de développement à la base ont été restructurés et renforcés, plus de 300 unités de transformations de produits agricoles installées et 1344 microprojets réalisés.  Plus de 2600 infrastructures sociocommunautaires de base (salles de classes, unités de soins périphériques, marchés, forages…) ont été réalisées. Egalement, le segment des filets sociaux a permis à 30 000 femmes de bénéficier de transferts monétaires et de créer plus de 27 000 emplois temporaires. 29 millions de repas chauds ont été servis dans plus de 300 écoles.  Au total, 92 milliards FCFA ont été nécessaires pour mettre en œuvre le PNDB entre 2012 et 2017. « Le bilan est satisfaisant, mais beaucoup reste à faire, plusieurs communautés, localités ont encore des besoins qu’il faut satisfaire », a souligné Victoire Tomégah-Dogbé.  Adopté en septembre 2012 en conseil des ministres, la PNDB demeure une approche pertinente et constitue un levier efficace de lutte contre la pauvreté et d’amélioration durable des conditions de vie des communautés.  Elle comprend un ensemble de projets financés par le gouvernement togolais, avec l’appui technique et financier de partenaires. Notamment, le Groupe de la Banque mondiale, la Banque africaine de développement, la Banque ouest-africaine de développement et le Programme des Nations unies pour le développement.  Image  La Ministre Victoire Tomégah-Dogbè a lancé la 10ème édition des VUC dans le cadre de la JIJ 2019  Lomé, le 12 Août 2019-  La 10ème édition du programme Vacances Utiles et Citoyennes (VUC) a été lancée ce lundi 12 août 2019 à Lomé par le ministre en charge du développement à la base, Victoire Tomégah-Dogbè.  L’événement s’inscrit dans le cadre de la célébration de la Journée Internationale de la Jeunesse (JIJ) placée cette année sous le thème « Transformer l’éducation ». A l’occasion, Victoire Tomegah-Dogbe a invité tous les acteurs à réfléchir à une éducation de qualité pour les enfants togolais.  La JIJ marque le démarrage  des activités estivales que sont le Tour de l’excellence, les centres aérés de vacances, le concours de projet d’associations de jeunes et les stages d’excellence...  Environ 300 parmi les meilleurs lauréats du BEPC issus des 5 régions bénéficient de cette initiative cette année. Quant à la journée internationale de la jeunesse elle-même, il faut rappeler qu’elle a été instituée en 1999 par les Nations Unies en vue d’amener les acteurs à réfléchir autour d’un thème lié à un enjeu majeur touchant au bien-être des jeunes.  Cette année, le thème « Transformer l’éducation » veut amener les acteurs à comprendre l’éducation comme la recherche du développement intégral, selon Victoire Tomegah-Dogbe.  « Ce thème nous interpelle et nous invite à réfléchir à l’éducation de qualité de notre jeunesse. Il intègre l’objectif de l’agenda pour le développement durable à l’horizon 2030 qui exige et recommande que l’on puisse assurer une éducation de qualité à tous. Egalement il rappelle à la conscience collective d’inscrire l’éducation dans une vision plus élargie » a ajouté le ministre en charge de la jeunesse. Notons que depuis 2010, ce sont plus de 6500 jeunes qui ont bénéficié des activités utiles et citoyennes.  Image   Le Togo va bénéficier de l’Initiative Prosper Africa du gouvernement américain     Lomé, le 12 Août 2019-   Le Gouverneur de l’Etat américain du Mississippi, Monsieur Phil Bryant, a entamé le dimanche 11 août 2019, une visite de travail de 3 jours au Togo, dans le cadre d’une tournée africaine.  A la tête d’une importante délégation composée des représentants du secteur privé américain, Phil Bryant a été reçu ce lundi par le Président de la République Togolaise, SEM Faure Essozimna Gnassingbé en présence du Premier ministre, Sélom Komi Klassou et de l’Ambassadeur des Etats-Unis au Togo, Eric Stromayer.  L’Etat du Mississippi souhaite accompagner le développement socio-économique du Togo à travers l’initiative Prosper Africa, conformément au Plan national de développement (PND, 2018-2022). Le Gouverneur Bryant a au cours des échanges présenté au chef de l’Etat les secteurs d’intervention de « l’initiative Prosper Africa » qui vise la mobilisation d’investissements directs américains vers l’Afrique.  « Nous sommes ici dans le cadre d’une initiative que nous appelons ‘’Prosper Africa’’, qui est en train d’être conduite, et nous osons dire que cette initiative pourra être également mise en œuvre au Togo », a-t-il déclaré au sortir de l’audience avant d’ajouter : « Nous pensons que le Togo avec à sa tête le chef de l’Etat togolais, joue un rôle leader dans la sous-région ouest africaine et donc serait un bon point de départ pour l’initiative ».  Phil Bryant a également expliqué à la presse que Prosper Africa permettra de faire venir au Togo des investisseurs pour mener des activités dans les secteurs de l’énergie, des infrastructures, de l’agriculture et de la santé.  A la suite de cette audience, le gouverneur a visité la foire Made In Togo où il a rencontré les femmes et hommes entrepreneurs bénéficiaires des programmes d’aides du Département d’Etat américain.  Il va pour la suite de son séjour, visiter la centrale de production électrique Contour Global, le Port Autonome de Lomé y compris Lomé Container Terminal, le poste juxtaposé de Noépé, le projet de parc industriel d’Adétikopé, et l’Institut de formation pour l’agro-développement (IFAD) à Elavagnon.  Cette visite renforce davantage les relations de coopération économique entre le Togo et les USA et permettra de rapprocher les secteurs privés togolais et l’Etat du Mississipi. L’Etat du Mississippi est l’un des premiers producteurs agricoles des Etats-Unis, et dispose également d’un secteur industriel performant accueillant de grandes multinationales.  Pour informations, Phil Bryant a prêté serment comme 64ème gouverneur de l’Etat de Mississippi en 2012 et a commencé son deuxième mandat en janvier 2016. Avant de prendre la direction de l’État, Bryant a été vice-gouverneur de 2008 à 2011.  En tant que gouverneur, Phil Bryant a dirigé le Mississippi dans la mise en œuvre de réformes transformationnelles de l’éducation publique, la promotion du développement économique et la création d’un climat commercial compétitif. Sous son administration, plus de 36 000 emplois ont été créés et plus de 7 milliards de dollars investis dans les entreprises.  Image   Les acteurs de l’éducation nationale préparent le lancement de la phase 3 du projet UNESCO-CFFIT Togo      Lomé, le 12 Août 2019-   Le Ministère des Enseignements Primaire et Secondaire (MEPS), a organisé le vendredi 9 Août 2019, à Lomé, un atelier de restitution de l’évaluation externe et de planification des activités de la phase 3 du projet UNESCO-CFIT Togo.  L’UNESCO-CFIT a pour objectif l’amélioration de la formation des enseignants pour combler le déficit qualitatif de l’éducation en Afrique, à travers l’introduction des Technologies de l’Information et de la Communication (TIC) dans les dispositifs de formation des enseignants.  Ce projet s’inscrit dans le cadre de l’ODD 4 qui vise à assurer à tous une éducation équitable, inclusive et des possibilités d’apprentissage tout au long de la vie.  Lancé en 2012, l’UNESCO-CFIT veut améliorer la formation des enseignants en Afrique sub-saharienne. Durant la mise en œuvre de sa phase II, le Togo et la Zambie ont rejoint les huit autres pays de la phase I. La phase II met à profit les réalisations de la phase I pour améliorer les capacités des institutions nationales clés d’éducation/formation des enseignants afin qu’elles fournissent une éducation et une formation de qualité.  En ouvrant les travaux de la rencontre, la Secrétaire Générale du Ministère des Enseignements Primaire et Secondaire, TITORA Tawim a déclaré que la rencontre est une occasion de faire le point sur les succès mais aussi les échecs pour mieux planifier la phase 3 du projet qui s’annonce dans un monde marqué par le développement de l’intelligence artificielle. « Il est donc important de voir comment l’intelligence artificielle pourra aider à combler le déficit qualitatif dans les pays africains » a-t-elle conclue.  A noter que les travaux se sont déroulés en présence du Secrétaire Général de la Commission Nationale Togolaise pour l’UNESCO, AGBOH Koffi Michel et de BIYAO Kokou Essohanam, Directeur des Formations MEPS et Point Focal UNESCO-CFIT.  Image   LE GOUVERNEUR DE L’ETAT DU MISSISSIPI CHEZ FAURE GNASSINGBÉ LE TOGO SERA LA PORTE D’ENTRÉE DE L’INITIATIVE “PROSPER AFRICA”  Lomé, le 12 Août 2019-  Le Gouverneur de l’Etat américain du Mississippi, Monsieur Phil Bryant, effectue du 11 au 14 août 2019 une visite de travail au Togo, dans le cadre de l’initiative « Prosper Africa ».  A la tête d’une importante délégation composée des représentants du secteur privé américain, Monsieur Phil Bryant a été reçu ce jour par le Président de la République Togolaise, SEM Faure Essozimna Gnassingbé.  Dans un entretien empreint de convivialité, le Gouverneur Bryant a présenté au chef de l’Etat  les secteurs d’intervention de l’initiative “Prosper Africa” qui vise la mobilisation d’investissements directs américains.  « Nous sommes ici dans le cadre d’une initiative que nous appelons ‘’Prosper Africa’’, qui est en train d’être conduite, et nous osons dire que cette initiative pourra être également mise en œuvre au Togo », a-t-il confié. “L’initiative ‘’Prosper Africa” concerne l’investissement direct étranger, notamment des Etats-Unis vers l’Afrique. Nous pensons que le Togo avec à sa tête le chef de l’Etat togolais, joue un rôle leader dans la sous-région ouest-africaine et donc serait un bon point de départ.  Il s’agira pour nous de faire venir au Togo des investisseurs qui vont mener des activités dans les secteurs de l’énergie, des infrastructures, de l’agriculture et de la santé ».  Durant son séjour au Togo, la délégation américaine aura des séances de travail avec des membres du gouvernement ainsi qu’avec les acteurs du secteur privé togolais.  Des visites de sites sont également prévues, notamment dans la zone portuaire de Lomé, à la foire du “Made in Togo”, à l’IFAD d’Elavagnon et au poste de contrôle juxtaposé de Noépé pour apprécier les opportunités d’investissement dans notre pays.  Cette visite renforce davantage les relations de coopération économique entre le Togo et les USA et permettra de rapprocher les secteurs privés togolais et l’Etat du Mississipi.

On August 31, a special ""Care Work Tour"" will honor the work of enslaved women and children, as well as indentured and free people, who took care of others. The tour will explore sites of care work, talk about what that work was day-to-day, and consider who got the credit. The cost of each tour is $20 per person. Spaces are limited.

Paré: The purpose of Providence Safe Stations is to address the overdose epidemic in Providence by providing hassle-free and immediate access to supportive services. Individuals living with substance use disorders may not be aware of the resources available  to them or have the ability to access them. Providence Safe Stations breaks down  barriers for individuals, allowing them access to critical supportive services  provided by a peer in recovery when and where they need them most. Individuals from anywhere in the region can come to any Providence Fire Station  at any time 7 days a week to seek help beginning January 2, 2018.  When they are  ready to seek help, Providence Safe Stations will provide the connection to begin treatment.  Providence Firefighters will secure any drugs that individuals may have and start the process to connecting them to recovery coaches and services to assist them with their addiction.  No questions asked and no consequences for disposing  of any drugs an individual may wish to surrender. Providence Safe Stations is based on the model from Manchester and Nashua, NH, which also experience high rates of opioid overdose deaths.  It is in alignment with the State of Rhode Island's Overdose Prevention Action Plan [http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001i99IwBGWeH14gF6KaZX8baB-oJd8rHqTCSbnGzvyb4at7O_kHTAi_aThtddb0wQeMJmLBItSK3QxNPAki27SUMbT1dBNHFAfmb3s95O4ikPq9MjxERI8HtlA5g0_QV1_rwPpknSU9Fw6JA3bQjTR2zZ8_erigZv6erX3fTGue7oknByTe7cwAa-jIKAnFPsA48kpPQgMJFQ=&c=zwZeVA-Cx9QPYDYtwMmfPkDwG1sQBu7X4AyUpbp74h6TweogRdK0Hg==&ch=HenSZobd3hLXVNGHt74ZAVnErAGP-USF9CisZO787BzyMAOu2HibsA==], which includes expansion of peer recovery services and access to treatment options for long-term recovery.

Lynne Bryan Phipps established Beachwood, an equine therapy center, to help people suffering with anxiety, trauma, and grief. The program has received a strong response in the RI Community.  In intensive equine therapy (IET), trained psychologists and counselors working  with specially selected horses help clients with a range of emotional issues. There is no riding and horse care is incidental to the process. The client learns to communicate with the horse - talk to the horse if you will - and read the horse. It can be fun, it certainly is interesting, takes focus and requires a horse with the ability to hold a connection. The client also interacts with the therapist - we call them trainers, who are highly skilled at reading and understanding horses and their behavior. We think our protocol is unique and quite often yields significant rewards and successes. So much so that Brown University has developed protocols for data collection to  document the remarkable healing rates.  Alternative therapies like equine therapy are not covered by insurance in RI, but we are finding that the costs associated with our work are far less than traditional approaches; a significant number are free or on a sliding scale. If you know of  someone who might benefit, please contact us.  Beachwood's website is www.beachwoodri.org [http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001i99IwBGWeH14gF6KaZX8baB-oJd8rHqTCSbnGzvyb4at7O_kHTAi_WbHq7usye805wmeLb6ugXuK0AS-CjFPeZl9SEuyzM4hu-gfD107vnu5SMsD8_ZJY26eB5u5GYSMxVHL2eZxau4ohqYH0ZnosSqGfnQ4x4O5fv2NbSg5P3b5McI_d761pg==&c=zwZeVA-Cx9QPYDYtwMmfPkDwG1sQBu7X4AyUpbp74h6TweogRdK0Hg==&ch=HenSZobd3hLXVNGHt74ZAVnErAGP-USF9CisZO787BzyMAOu2HibsA==] or call Rev.

5000g000028cDKlAAM,Elections and Audits Updates from Secretary Clarno,"Newsletter from Secretary Bev Clarno [ https://sos.oregon.gov/Pages/index.aspx ]________________________________________________________________________  900 Court Street NE, Salem, Oregon 97310 - oregon.sos@oregon.gov  ________________________________________________________________________    *News from the Secretary of State*  2020 Census  You may know that the next federal census takes place in 2020. The information gained during this census will be used to redraw Congressional and legislative district boundaries for the next decade. Under Article IV, section 6, of the Oregon Constitution, the Legislature must try to agree on what those new boundaries will be. If it does not, or if it does so inadequately, the Secretary of States Office must redraw the lines itself. Due to rapid population growth over the last ten years, Oregon is expected to gain a Congressional seat in the next redistrictingbringing us from five members in the U.S. House of Representatives to six. As such, it is important that the information gathered during the census be as accurate as possible. Our office has been asked to assist in outreach efforts to communicate that importance and encourage all Oregonians to participate in the censusparticularly some of the traditionally hard-to-count populations, such as young children, racial and ethnic minorities, and low income persons. This is something we are delighted to help do.  Deschutes County Picnic  Deschutes Picnic   On July 13th, I attended the Deschutes County Republican Partys annual Summer Picnic in Bend. As Secretary of State, and Oregons chief elections officer, I make a special point to speak to all organizations that invite meRepublican or Democrat. As the keynote speaker, I discussed the core functions of the Secretary of States Office, some of the recent audits that we have conducted, and some of the highlights from the 2019 legislative session. About 100 people were in attendance, including State Senator Tim Knopp, State Representatives Jack Zika and Cheri Helt, and Deschutes County Commissioners Phil Henderson, Patti Adair, and Tony DeBone.     County Elections Offices  Hood River   On July 15th, during my drive home to Redmond, I visited three County Elections Offices in Eastern Oregon to hear from local officials. My first stop was in Hood River, where I met with the Hood River County Clerk, Brian Beebe. Brian is unique among county clerks in Oregon because, in addition to serving as County Clerk, he also serves as County Assessor. He therefore manages the county's Records and Assessment Department as well as its elections. Brians Chief Deputy, Kim Kean, has served the County for over thirty years.     Wasco   Next, I stopped in The Dalles, where I met with the Wasco County Clerk [ https://www.co.wasco.or.us/departments/clerk/index.php ], Lisa Gambee, and Wasco County Commissioner Steve Kramer. While there, I also had the opportunity to observe some of the Countys historical collectionsmuch of which consisted of memorabilia from the Rajneesh movement that settled near Antelope in the early 1980s. Such a fascinating time in Oregons history. Finally, I met with Jenine McDermid, the Sherman County Clerk [ https://www.co.sherman.or.us/departments/sherman-county-clerks-office/ ], in Moro. Her husband, Ron, who is also a Justice of the Peace, gave me a tour of their historic courthouse, which was built in 1899.     Sherman   Some of these individuals expressed concerns about the additional administrative burden that newly-enacted legislation will place on their already-tight budgets. Others expressed appreciation for all that our Archives Division [ https://sos.oregon.gov/archives/Pages/default.aspx ] does to help with the management of their counties records, and all that our Elections Division [ https://sos.oregon.gov/voting-elections/Pages/default.aspx ] does to help them conduct fair and secure elections. I appreciated the opportunity to meet with them and to discuss how our state government can better serve Oregonians.     Eastern Oregon Economic Summit  Summit   On July 26th, I attended the inaugural Eastern Oregon Economic Summit in Hermiston. This gatheringthe first of its kindwas organized by the Eastern Oregon Womens Coalition [ https://www.eowc.biz/ ], a nonprofit charitable organization dedicated to educating Oregonians about Eastern Oregons businesses and rural way of life. The purpose of the Summit was to have an in-depth discussion about the various factors affecting rural Oregons economy, from the impacts of 2019 legislation to recent changes in technology, demographics, and the environment. Over 200 people were in attendance, including local, state, and federal elected officials, as well as representatives from approximately 100 businesses in the region.  In particular, attendees heard from Ken Bisconer, the director of West Coast flight operations for PAE ISR [ https://www.paeisr.com/ ], a Virginia-based aerospace firm that develops advanced tactical equipment and communications systems, including FLIR thermal imaging cameras, for drones and other aircraft. This technology is useful for fighting forest fires and discovering insect infestations, among other things. PAE ISR currently leases a hangar at the Pendleton airport. Ken told attendees that his company chose Eastern Oregon not only to take advantage of the large flight area, but also for the quality of life that it affords their employeeswonderful communities, beautiful surroundings, and endless opportunities for outdoor recreation. I couldnt agree more. Eastern Oregon is a wonderful place to live, work, and play. Special thanks to the Eastern Oregon Womens Coalition for organizing the event and for inviting me to attend. I look forward to next years Summit!     Oregon China Council  OCC   Also on July 26th, the Deputy Secretary of State, Rich Vial, gave the welcome address at the 9th Oregon-China Economic Forum in Oregon City, the theme of which was Building the Bridge to our Common Dreams and Sustainable Future. This event is sponsored each year by the Oregon China Council [ https://oregonchinacouncil.org/ ]. Numerous dignitaries from China, as well as local business and government leaders, were in attendance. Deputy Vial was accompanied by his daughter-in-law, Liyan Huynh, who was born in China and who provided simultaneous translation of his remarks. Deputy Vial spoke about the many things that former Secretary of State Dennis Richardson did to improve trade between Oregon and China, and he encouraged those in attendance to see past their cultural differences and to develop lasting, meaningful relationships with one another.     Going the Extra Mile  Corinna   On July 29th, I invited Corinna Tanguy to my office in the Capitol to personally thank her for her hard work. Corinna is part of the Contact Center team for Secretary of States Corporations Division [ https://sos.oregon.gov/business/Pages/default.aspx ], where she spends her days working directly with business, notary, and Uniform Commercial Code customers. Most importantly, she does it all with a positive attitude. At a time when our Contact Center was low on staff, Corinna really brought her A-gametaking an average of 100 calls per day and replying to customer emails in between. In her spare time, Corinna participates in the Divisions Quick Response Team as well as the Secretary of States Inclusion and Diversity Council. She is an incredible example of a team player, par excellence!  In addition, the Audits Division would like to recognize the initiative and impact of two auditors, Jamie Ralls and Ian Green, who went above and beyond and found a way to use data analysis to help federal investigators identify potential fraud in the food stamp program. After conducting a 2012 audit of public assistance programs, Jamie and Ian had access to vast troves of data on these programs, including Oregons Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), otherwise known as food stamps. After analyzing the data and identifying common red flags for fraud, the two were able to successfully compile a list of SNAP merchants with multiple fraud indicators and share it with the FBI. While they are still ongoing, these efforts have already led to the successful prosecution and conviction of five merchants, including a meat market in Klamath Falls with ties to a Mexican drug cartel; lifetime bans for 59 SNAP recipients who were committing fraud; and over $525,000 in restitution paid to the state. I want to thank Jamie and Ian for their commitment to identifying government fraud, waste, and abuse. Their story is yet another example of how hard your government is working for you.     Public Auditor of the Republic of Palau  Palau   On July 30th, Satrunino ""Nino"" Tewid, Public Auditor for the Republic of Palau, came to Oregon to visit the Secretary of States Audits Division.Given recentchanges to Government Auditing Standards,Nino requested assistance from our Audits Division with his performance audit policies and procedures.He and Kip Memmott, Director of our Audits Division, agreed that a collaborative relationship has been established between their offices, and they are committed to speaking again in the near future. One of the things that I appreciate most about our Audits Division is that they are not afraid to think outside the box and to exchange best practices with other government auditorsnot just around the country but around the world! I believe the free flow of ideas, opinions, and information drives innovation. Perhaps that is why the Audits Division has won numerous Excellence in Accountability Awards from the National State Auditors Association.     Department of Administrative Services Audit  On July 31st, my office released an audit report highlighting three areas in which the Department of Administrative Services [ https://www.oregon.gov/das/pages/index.aspx ] (DAS) can enhace transparency and help lawmakers to make informed decisions when crafting the States budget. Both Legislators and the public need to know how state agencies spend their money. The report, which you can read here [ https://sos.oregon.gov/audits/Documents/2019-29.pdf ], explains that state agencies will often hire two or more employees for one position, and quickly spend money towards the end of a budgeting cycle. It also found that the States Transparency Website [ https://www.oregon.gov/transparency/Pages/index.aspx ] can be difficult for Oregonians to use and, in some ways, incomplete. The report makes sixteen recommendations for things that DAS can do to help address these issues. I want to thank our Audits Division for their hard work in pulling this project together, and I want to thank DAS for their cooperation throughout the process. Identifying ways in which we can make government more efficient is a victory for all Oregonians.  Oregon Youth Challenge Program  Jasmyn   On August 5th, I attended a ceremony where Jasmyn Troncoso was sworn in to the Deschutes County District Attorneys Office [ http://www.dcda.us/ ] as Deputy District Attorney. While attending high school in Gresham, Jasmyn struggled with her grades. When she was sixteen years old, she entered the Oregon National Guard Youth Challenge Program [ https://www.oycp.com/ ] (OYCP), which provides opportunities for personal growth, self-improvement, and academic achievement for at-risk high school students through a highly structured, non-traditional environment. Jasmyn excelled in the OYCP, working as a librarian, building maintenance custodian, and phone duty receptionist, and holding various positions of leadership in her platoon. In 2006, she graduated from the program with her GED and enrolled at Mt. Hood Community College. In 2017, she graduated at the top of her class from Loyola Law School, and was eventually hired by the Deschutes County District Attorneys Office. District Attorney John Hummel asked that Jasmyns swearing in ceremony be conducted at the Youth Challenge Program, which played such a pivotal role in her success story. As both a public servant and someone who has served on the OYCPs Board of Directors for over 25 years, being able to attend Jasmyns ceremony was particularly meaningful for me. It is so encouraging to see some of the real life, positive effects that this program has on Oregons most vulnerable youth. Congratulations, Jasmyn. Youve made us all so proud.     Oregon Matters of State Podcasts  In case you missed it, Deputy Secretary Rich Vial has begun a series of podcasts, entitled Oregon Matters of State, to give Oregonians a peak behind the curtain and to help them better understand not only ""what"" the Secretary of States Office and its various divisions do, but ""who"" it is the state has hired to lead those important efforts. I believe our office has some of the most qualified agency directors in the countryand I know first-hand how hard they work for Oregonians. It is my hope that these podcasts will serve to introduce them to the people of Oregon and to inform Oregonians how our office can better serve them. You can listen to the first two episodes, wherein Deputy Vial interviews me and the Director of the Elections Division, Steve Trout, by following the link on the left-hand side of our website [ https://sos.oregon.gov/Pages/index.aspx ].  As always, it is an honor to serve as your Secretary of State.  Sincerely,  Bev Clarno signature  Bev Clarno          Having trouble viewing this email?

To read GFA’s special report  titled “Fighting Malaria—a Chilling Disease,” visit: ** https://inchristcommunications.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e3746de33f5451f19df787d41&id=88b42b069b&e=70980e1f90 (https://inchristcommunications.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e3746de33f5451f19df787d41&id=c43be37151&e=70980e1f90) .  “It only takes one mosquito to kill a child,” said GFA founder, Dr. K.P. Yohannan, explaining that seven out of every 10 mosquito-caused deaths are children under age five, but a simple mosquito net costing $10 could save a child’s life. GFA provides people with the opportunity to donate mosquito nets at ** https://inchristcommunications.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e3746de33f5451f19df787d41&id=fe30e07909&e=70980e1f90 (https://inchristcommunications.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e3746de33f5451f19df787d41&id=454a80723d&e=70980e1f90) .  Mosquitoes were responsible for nearly 220 million malaria cases around the world in 2017, resulting in 435,000 related deaths—nearly one every minute—according to the World Health Organization’s (WHO’s) latest World Malaria Report.  On August 20, 1897, India-born British doctor Sir Ronald Ross discovered that the bite of parasite-infected female mosquitoes transmits malaria – and declared that the date should be commemorated as World Mosquito Day each year.  “As GFA combats these mosquitoes and the deadly diseases they carry, we’re seeking to minimize the risk of children being infected,” Yohannan said. “It’s part of our commitment to the remote communities we serve and one way to express God’s love for them.”  This year, health workers at more than a thousand GFA-supported medical camps in Asia will teach families the importance of sleeping every night under a mosquito net and making sure they remove stagnant water around their homes to eliminate mosquito breeding grounds.  In 2018, GFA-supported workers helped distribute 360,000 free mosquito nets to vulnerable families across Asia, and similar malaria prevention efforts are underway this year.  “Many villagers in remote areas can’t afford to buy mosquito nets or preventive medications,” Yohannan said. “This is why our efforts are so critical and show people that we really do care about them.”  Malaria is just one of numerous deadly diseases transmitted by the bloodsucking insect. In tropical and subtropical regions of the world—mostly in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia—mosquito-borne dengue fever, yellow fever, West Nile virus, African sleeping sickness, and encephalitis ravage extremely poor communities that lack basic healthcare. A female mosquito can live up to eight weeks and lay hundreds of eggs.  Malaria was close to being eradicated in the 1950s, but it soon surged again to epidemic levels in India, Indonesia, Kenya, Uganda, Nigeria and other impoverished nations.  Despite this resurgence, WHO reported that the number of malaria cases in India in 2017 declined 24 percent from the previous year, raising hopes of major progress against the disease in the heavily impacted eastern state of Odisha on the Bay of Bengal.  Combating malaria is one of WHO’s eight Millennium Development Goals, and the agency is currently field-testing the first malaria vaccine—potentially a huge breakthrough.  Although unusual in the United States, the U.S. is not immune to deadly mosquito-borne diseases. In July, health officials in central Florida discovered a rare form of mosquito-transmitted encephalitis that can cause fatal brain swelling.

5000g000028bwUaAAI,New Team Members,"~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Greetings! I hope you're doing well. Our GM Alex has resigned to pursue a new career as a teacher and we want to wish  him the best. With his exit we have hired some new team members that will be starting over the next couple of weeks. In the meantime myself and other existing team members can help you if Alex has been your usual point of contact. Something I do want to address while I have your attention, is we get a lot of emails to place orders or request quotes, which is fine but it does leave a margin for  error, in that I myself will get an email, start to work on putting in the order  or send back a quote, get a call, get pulled away from my desk or any other number of reasons that my attention gets divided, resulting in the action not being completed and leaving your request unaddressed. If you do not get a response or get an order confirmation for an email you sent,  please follow up with us to ensure we do fulfill your request.

Chantal Guillon came to the US not knowing English well, started her macaron business in the heart of SF during the 08' recession, and just launched new vegan macarons.     Chantal Guillon has garnered major clientele, and celebrities like Whoopi Goldberg choose it as a go-to for fun gifts. The best way to find out why is to try it yourself, and the ladies of Chantal Guillon would be happy to invite you to the store to see how the macarons are made or ship some samples to you. :)       I could set up an interview with the CEO of Chantal Guillon herself, and you can meet the woman behind the success of SF's first specialized macaron business.      Any interest? Please let me know.      Best,  Jack                Parisian Patisserie Thriving Since ‘08 Recession in San Francisco: Meet The Woman Behind It All             August 2019           San Francisco, CA, August 2019 -- San Francisco-based Chantal Guillon invites you to try their ultimate Parisian-Californian dessert, the macaron. The Chantal Guillon macaron brings the Parisian patisserie and American appetite together in its unique experience-forward sweet tooth indulgences. One bite into a Chantal Guillon macaron immerses one into an experience of multiple flavors and textures, a love affair for dessert. The best way to understand why celebrities, such as Whoopi Goldberg and Olympic Athlete Josh Prenot, choose Chantal Guillon macarons is to try them for yourself.            A Bit of History     The macaron appeared in Europe during the Middle Ages. In France, it has become one of the most loved high-end sweet treats, and its history is tightly linked with the monarchy. Catherine de Medicis apparently had macarons served at the wedding of Duc Anne de Joyeuse, in Ardèche, in 1581. Macarons also appeared in Saint-Jean-de-Luz in 1660, where a baker offered a few to king Louis XIV for his wedding.            Taking the Bay Area by storm with the French heritage royal delicacy, Chantal Guillon is the leading artisan baker of the Bay Area, and you are welcome to visit the shop, bake with their team, and learn the founder’s story.            A Success Story Made Out of “Little Divas”      “I started as an entrepreneur looking for a new challenge and a mother who wanted to be closer to her kids in the US. The challenge was scary, to start in a new country without even speaking the language, but the excitement of creating a new business by offering something that my family always loved and to be close to my children won me over and made me take a leap of faith.” -- Chantal Guillon, CEO            Macarons, or as Chantal calls them, “Little Divas,” blended Chantal’s careers. Coming from a background in luxury interior design and the previous owner of a Parisian restaurant, macarons were a way to combine those two experience into Chantal’s next one. “It was very important to me to offer the best macaron to San Francisco, not just a crunchy flavored cookie, by creating a true Parisian experience in each detail of the macaron, a delectable taste and offering a gift-giving experience with a desirable packaging,” says Chantal.            With a delicious product complimented by a fashion-forward travel box, Chantal Guillon soon became the perfect go-to gift in San Francisco, combining taste and beauty. Creating limited-edition flavors and gift boxes for every occasion.                     About Chantal Guillon ®     The success of the independent small business is the result of a serial entrepreneur, Chantal Guillon, a Paris to SF expat who started her shop to create a space for fun and sweet tooth joy in the most innovative city in America.

Product: csmonitor.com  Message: Why Is China Investing Billions in Africa? | NowThis World 215,529 views  4.2K  619  SHARE  SAVE   NowThis World Published on Dec 16, 2018 China has invested billions of dollars into the continent of Africa to build massive infrastructure projects in African countries. Much of this infrastructure is part of China’s Belt and Road Initiative, an estimated 1 trillion dollar plan to connect the country to trade routes all over the world. » Subscribe to NowThis World: http://go.nowth.is/World_Subscribe » Watch the Previous Episode: https://go.nowth.is/2LhNmtv  While China’s Belt and Road Initiative was only proposed in 2013, the country’s first infrastructure project on the African continent was built decades ago. The TazaHra railway, completed in 1976, was built to connect copper mines in Zambia to Dar EH Salaam, Tanzania’s former capital. The TazHara railway was the first infrastructure project built on a pan-African scale.  China’s Belt and Road projects will be designed to create new trade routes within and between African countries. In 2017, a Chinese firm opened a railway network in Kenya, connecting its capital Nairobi to the port city of Mombasa. There are already plans to extend this network into South Sudan, Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi.  Many observers worry that African countries won’t be able to pay back these debts, placing them in what’s been called a quote “debt trap.” But others think that as African countries rise economically, they could actually have the upper hand by the time they negotiate payments back to China. This explains why African leaders have been so confident in calling Chinese investment a “win-win.”  But is China’s investment in the continent actually a “win-win”  as some African and Chinese leaders have said? OR is it just a new form of colonialism on a continent that’s experienced so much of it? In this episode, we’re examining China’s Belt and Road Initiative and what it might mean for Africa.

5000g000028cGJ7AAM,Guest Byline: Benefits of Breastmilk and Where to Find it Naturally to Benefit Adolescent Growth,"Hi Stephanie,  Hope you are enjoying your summer. August is breastfeeding awareness month but even without that timely angle below is an informative article from Kristine Gedroic, M.D (https://www.gedroiccenter.com/healing-arts) . Director of The Gedroic Medical Institute, graduate from Harvard University with a degree in biochemical sciences and medical school at Thomas Jefferson University. In the piece she offers advice and great options if you are unable to breastfeed as well.  Dr. Gedroic book was just endorsed by Dr. Weil, Dr.Oz and Deepak Chopra: A Nation Unwell.  Full article follows below my signature line. Please let me know if you wish to run it.  My very best,  Janet Shapiro / Director Publicity Services  SMITH PUBLICITY, INC.  Since 1997, promoting thousands of experts, authors & books  Janet@smithpublicity.com • 856-489-8654 x320  How Breast Milk Shapes the Gut  “The Key to Better Long-Term Health”  By Kristine Gedroic, MD  There is simply no better food for an infant than a mother’s breast milk. The body is truly amazing; it creates and produces breast milk to support a growing and developing baby, why breast milk has often been called nature’s perfect first food. When you think about it, breast milk is an evolutionary guarantee that our offspring will survive—and thrive—long term, which is why the health benefits of breastfeeding are extensive.  Breastfeeding exclusively for at least a year, which is the critical time frame when the cells of the body and brain are becoming established, has been shown to have significant benefits on a child’s physical and mental health, advantages that carry well into adulthood. This is why one of the first questions that I ask a new patient is whether he or she was breastfed as an infant.  Numerous studies show that children who are breastfed exclusively are less prone—throughout their lives—to obesity, allergies, eczema, diabetes, asthma, respiratory illnesses, ear infections, and digestive problems, as well as being at less risk of developing autoimmune diseases like type 1 diabetes and multiple sclerosis. Breastfeeding for at least a year has also been linked to better mental health, including less depression and stress-related and behavioral issues—through age 14, though I would argue that this benefit extends into adulthood.  The question is, why does breastmilk have such a powerful effect on health? Yes, breast milk has a rich balance of healthy nutrients for a rapidly developing infant including lactose or milk sugars, protein, and fat. But breast milk’s effects on health has more to do with its impact on early formation of the gut, which has been found in recent years to benefit the body and brain long term.   The Gut: Where Health Begins  The gut is where our health begins, and it’s immediately after birth that the gut begins to form into anenterotype—a scientific name for an ecosystem—which is conserved for the rest of our lives. In fact, this early shaping of the gut, which includes the formation of critical health-promoting bacterial species, can onlyhappen in infancy and early childhood. Research (https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40124-014-0051-y) has shown, that after the age of three—despite any attempts to change this otherwise—we simply cannot recreate these same bacterial colonies, which include a core of more than nine bacterial types including Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Lactobacillus,Bacteroides, and Bifidobacterium.  We can change the numbers of bacteria in the gut through the use of probiotics, but we cannot affect these initial colonies of bacteria. This can only be established in infancy—which is why breast milk is absolutely critical for the lifetime health of the gut.   • A healthy gut stimulates a strong immune system.The right balance of bacteria in the gut stimulates the healthy development of our immune system. The bacterial colonies found in breast milk, along with something called oligosaccharides or HMOs that act as prebiotics to feed gut bacteria and antimicrobials to inhibit the growth of harmful bacteria, are the primary stimulus for the development of our immunity.  According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, breast milk is also rich in antibodies like IgA, which help to prevent infections and other illnesses by blocking pathogens from attaching to the gut. This explains why breastfed infants are less likely to develop health problems like ear and respiratory infections as infants and later on as adolescents and adults.  • A healthy gut is key to balanced brain health. As the gut develops, so too does the brain.Breast milk is a rich source of essential fatty acids, which are critical for healthy neurological development, and hormones like leptin that seem to have a stress-reducing effect on an infant’s behavior, according to one study (https://szczepienia.wybudzeni.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Oddy10mentalhealth.pdf) in The Journal of Pediatrics.  We also know that the gut communicates with every part of the body, including the nervous system and the brain through something called the gut-brain axis. What this means: when the gut is balanced, it sends signals up to the brain allowing for optimal neuronal development and circuitry. The result: an infant’s overall mood is calmer and his/her neurological behavior is regulated.  What to Do If You Can’t Breastfeed  I understand that sometimes breastfeeding isn’t possible. While the benefits of breastfeeding can’t be completely transferred to formula feeding, it ispossible to mitigate some of the effects of not breastfeeding by doing these things:  Do what and when you can.Any breast milk is better than none, so even low milk producers are doing their babies a ton of good by offering some breast milk along with formula. If you can’t physically breastfeed, the latest pumps are discrete and efficient, so it’s easier than ever to incorporate pumping breastmilk into a busy schedule. I recommend doing what you can for as long as your milk supply lasts; if possible, for at least a year.  Choose an organic formula with prebiotics, probiotics, and essential fatty acids. While formulas can’t match breast milk’s composition, the newest formulas do contain some essential components that can help feed a baby’s gut.  Bottom line: breast milk is absolutely the best form of food for your baby, but your infant can have a healthier gut if you have to supplement or feed your baby formula.  ###  Kristine Gedroic, MD, is author of A Nation of Unwelland Medical Director of the Gedroic Medical Institute in Morristown, NJ.

5000g000028cFLvAAM,"As 9/11 Anniversary Approaches, New Book Informs Kids About The Day: 9/11 Courage and Tributes","Dear Stephanie Hanes :  America pledged to 'Never Forget' the events of September 11, 2001. But as the 18th anniversary of our nation's darkest day approaches, there's more to do to ensure future generations also never forget.  Author and Context Productions CEO Kristie Kiernan Bouryal's new release for children, 9/11 Courage and Tributes, was written to raise awareness to the events of that fateful day and is a tribute to the fallen and the courage of everyday heroes. It is the author's intention that the three books in her Discovering Heroes™ series, which are all based on true events, will help children to better understand that day, its aftermath and the bravery of the men and women who lost their lives and those who carried on. The author's parents (her father was a former lieutenant in the NYC Fire Department and her mother a former nurse), were the inspiration behind the series.   Please read the following press release and let me know if I may forward a copy of Kristie's new book in consideration of an interview or review from you. If you wish to do a feature story, I'd be happy to send JPEGs of the author and book cover. Thank you.  Brian Johnson Ascot Media Group, Inc. Post Office Box 2394 Friendswood, TX 77549 news@ascotmedianews.com ascotmedia.com 281.333.3507 Phone 800.854.2207 Fax  (This press release may be reprinted in part or entirety by any print or broadcast media outlet, or used by any means of social media sharing)  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  As 9/11 Anniversary Approaches, New Book Informs Kids About The Day, The Courage Of The Fallen And Everyday Heroes  **New York, NY, August 15, 2019** — Context Productions, a media company, is releasing its latest book for kids, 9/11 Courage and Tributes. The book is the third in the Discovering Heroes™ series, which increases awareness about September 11, 2001 and everyday heroes.  ""We have a whole generation of kids who are largely uninformed about 9/11, yet we are on track to lose more people to 9/11-related illnesses than we lost that day,” said CEO and Author Kristie Kiernan Bouryal.   According to the World Trade Center (WTC) Health Program as of March 31, 2019, more than 95,000 people enrolled in the program and more than 49,000 have at least one disease certified as a 9/11-related illness. Since 9/11, more than 2,350 members of the program have died—over 2,100 were first responders.   ""9/11 is a day that is still harming people – and this is going to continue for years to come. Many vowed to 'Never Forget,' but those words require action. I'm calling on every educator, parent, grandparent, close relative or friend of a child to use this book and others in the series to engage kids about 9/11,” said Bouryal.   Bouryal's books are all based on true events. Her parents, John Kiernan, a former lieutenant in the Fire Department of the City of New York (FDNY), and Benita Kiernan, a former nurse, inspired the series. They are the grandparent characters in the series who lovingly inform their grandchildren about 9/11, and the fallen and everyday heroes, by responding to the kids' many questions.    In 9/11 Courage and Tributes, the family visits special tributes created to honor and remember those we lost. The grandkids learn about the courage of everyday heroes, including their role in America's largest water evacuation, and that 9/11 is still harming people.   In the second book in the series, Remembering Heroes, the family visits FDNY's Rescue Company 1 in New York City to attend a memorial service for 9/11. There, the kids learn about the nearly 3,000 people lost that day, including the 343 members of the FDNY and the 11 fallen heroes from that firehouse, all while they explore the meaning of everyday heroes and see them in action. In the first book of the series, My Buddy's a Hero – And I Didn't Even Know It, the grandkids learn for the first time that their grandfather was part of the rescue and recovery efforts and helped rescue the last man out alive from the ruins of the World Trade Center.   This series of books is fitting for kids of all ages, especially seven through eleven. Teaching tools for the books are available at www.contextproductions.com, including activities that kids can complete and share with Bouryal for publishing consideration online or in print.   About Context Productions:   Context Productions is a media company that creates and publishes content for kids. Our Discovering Heroes™ series of non-fiction, chapter books reveal first-person accounts of heroism tied to September 11, 2001 and help kids uncover stories of everyday heroes in their lives.

5000g000028cCIZAA2,Capital is Dead...is this something worse? by McKenzie Wark,"It’s not capitalism, it’s not neoliberalism—what if it’s something worse?   Capital is Dead  Is this something worse?  by McKenzie Wark Request Review Copy (mailto:wes@versobooks.com?subject=Review%20Copy%20Request%3A%20Capital%20is%20Dead) https://www.versobooks.com/books/3056-capital-is-deadAdvance Praise  ""Counter-intuitive, insightful, and imaginative, Capital is Dead is a timely reminder that there are things worse than capitalism—and we may just be living through them."" -- Nick Srnicek, author of Inventing the Future  “Consider this your exploratory field guide to a new mode of production.” -- Kate Crawford, Distinguished Research Professor and cofounder of the AI Now Institute, New York University  It’s not capitalism, it’s not neoliberalism — what if it’s something worse? ------------------------------------------------------------ Hardback / $24.95 / October 8, 2019 / 9781788735308 ------------------------------------------------------------  In this radical and visionary new book, McKenzie Wark argues that information has empowered a new kind of ruling class. Through the ownership and control of information, this emergent class ominates not only labour but capital as traditionally understood as well. And it's not just tech companies like Amazon and Google. Even Walmart and Nike can now dominate the entire production chain through the ownership of not much more than brands, patents, copyrights, and logistical systems.  While techno-utopian apologists still celebrate these innovations as improvements on capitalism, for workers — and the planet workers — it's worse. The new ruling class uses the powers of information to route around any obstacle labor and social movements put up. So how do we find a way out? Capital is Dead offers not only the theoretical tools to analyze this new world, but ways to change it. Drawing on the writings of a suprising range of classic and contemporary theorists, Wark offers and illuminating overview of the contemporary condition and the emerging classes that control - and contest - it.  McKenzie Wark is the author of A Hacker Manifesto, Gamer Theory, 50 Years of Recuperation of the Situationist International and The Beach Beneath the Street, among other books. They teach at the New School for Social Research and Eugene Lang College in New York City.

5000g000028c1eqAAA,Boston - One of the worst places to buy a home,"Hello,   If you’re looking to buy in *Boston*, you might want to think again. A new study by GOBankingRates <https://www.gobankingrates.com/investing/real-estate/worst-places-buy-home-where-invest-instead/> found that buyers looking to invest in a home in one of America’s best-known cities may want to rethink the location.    Boston landed on the list of the 15 Worst Places To Buy a Home – and Where To Invest Instead <https://www.gobankingrates.com/investing/real-estate/worst-places-buy-home-where-invest-instead/>    *Don't Buy a Home in Boston <https://www.gobankingrates.com/investing/real-estate/worst-places-buy-home-where-invest-instead/#2>*     - *1-year home value change:** 2.5%*    - *5-year home value change:** 43%*  *Boston may boast great attractions like Fenway Park and Boston Harbor, but it’s probably not the best place to buy your starter home. Its real estate runs at a pretty high price per square foot, $724.90, for a relatively low return. Property crime isn’t great either at 22.54 offenses per 1,000 residents.*  *Instead, Choose Brockton <https://www.gobankingrates.com/investing/real-estate/worst-places-buy-home-where-invest-instead/#3>*     - *1-year home value change:** 6.8%*    - *5-year home value change:** 59.6%*  *While violent and property crime rates are still a little higher in Brockton than one would prefer, the city offers proximity to all that Boston has to offer in a little more than an hour’s drive, with a much more pocket-friendly rate of $223.75 per square foot and a 6.8% one-year home value change*.    For this study <https://www.gobankingrates.com/investing/real-estate/worst-places-buy-home-where-invest-instead/>, GOBankingRates analyzed the most expensive metro areas in the U.S. in terms of home price per square foot. The study then evaluated more affordable cities within each metro area by looking at the one- and five-year changes in median home value, percentage of homes with negative equity and violent and property crime rates to help prospective homebuyers identify some fantastic places to invest in.    Please let me know if you are interested in using the study for a story. I would be happy to connect you with one of the researchers for more information or an interview.

5000g000028c4WbAAI,Can You Trust a DIY Pregnancy Test? Yale OB/GYN Discusses What To Know,"Hi Stephanie?,  From the earliest moments of conception, your body is already starting to undergo monumental changes. One of the very first is production of the pregnancy hormone, hCG (human Chorionic Gonadotropin), which can be detected in your blood and in your urine.  With the rise in DIY pregnancy tests and at-home alternatives, Mary Jane Minkin, MD Clinical Professor, Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences at Yale School of Medicine is available to discuss what women should know about how pregnancy tests work—explaining everything from false negatives to false positives and how soon after a missed period you can get an accurate reading.  Please let me know if I can put you in touch with her in the coming weeks.

God made us to resemble and reflect His worth as we enjoy our true identity in Him. &nbsp; But we too often swap that calling for the trifles of this world, pursuing cheap substitutes to fill the craving of our souls. As Jonathan Parnell puts it, we settle for “stupid normal” over the transcendent, even though this world can never satisfy our hopes and dreams.  $1.99 (reg. $11.99)  (http://l.e.waterbrookmultnomah.com/rts/go2.aspx?t=1705772&tp=i-H43-Q58-Plr-1iwjBQ-1o-LVVM-1c-1iwv0R-1KHVlg&x=2E066F15826E2B38E0534FD66B0AFA34)"" data-link-name=""9780307781666_bookcover  Brokenness Made BeautifulThe car accident that killed Abby Pattersons husband and daughter has left her with a limp and chronic pain.

Surprising to many, this life is not measured by success, comparison, or accolades. Rather, free and joyful living stems from a God-centered celebration of our union with Christ and the lives of those around us. Jon Tysons exploration of the reverse economy of the kingdom frees his readers from merit-based living...not just in terms of salvation, but daily, earthly value. Life is not meant to be a series of competitions or a survival of the fittest rat race. Yet so many of the messages around us and so many of the voices bombarding our hearts and minds tie up our value and package it with our accolades.  $1.99 (reg. $13.99)  (http://l.e.waterbrookmultnomah.com/rts/go2.aspx?t=1705784&tp=i-H43-Q58-Plr-1iwjBQ-1o-LVVM-1c-1iwv0R-1KHVlg&x=2E066F15826E2B38E0534FD66B0AFA34)"" data-link-name=""9780307785961_bookcover  Collision Course to Troubled WatersRancher Dan Jarrett doesnt trust most people, especially&nbsp;not his new stepfather.

Relaxing on a cruise filled with love and laughter sounds like the perfect prescription for healing. And Sunnys unsinkable spirit and penchant for zany disasters provide an ample dose of both.Before this hilarious high-sea adventure is over, these two stubborn hearts will hit the unfamiliar waters of trust—trust in each other and in the One who knows better than we ever could exactly what we need to be whole.  eBook sales run through 8/25/2019.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  CONTACT: Cindy Dupree  PHONE: (615) 327-0100  EMAIL: cindy.dupree@plamedia.com (mailto:cindy.dupree@plamedia.com)  PEG LUKE’S EXTRAORDINARY WORK “PSALM SPACE”   NOW AVAILABLE  “Holy Music with Healing Properties”  “Psalm Space,” the musical creation written by Peg Luke, composer and world-renowned flutist, is now available on Spotify, Pandora, Apple Music, as well as in many brick and mortar outlets nation-wide. “Psalm Space” interprets six popular Biblical Psalms, as well as new versions of “The Lord’s Prayer,” “Kum Bah Yah,” and more. Among other achievements, Peg Luke has performed 12 sold-out Carnegie Hall flute recitals.  The deeply spiritual music of “Psalm Space” was created to bring soul-nourishment to the masses. Purposely written using the French Taize technique, the sound creates a calming effect and gives listeners a chance to meditate, heal, emote kindness and peace. The work is meant to inspire relaxation and restoration, whether driving home from a hectic day at work or suffering a tragic loss.   “Psalm Space exists to bring hope and healing to people who need encouragement. Throughout the entire process, I quickly became aware of the power of this music to touch and help people,” Luke says. “It’s my gift to the world, and I am very grateful for all the people that made this vision a reality.”  “Psalm Space” was produced by multi-Grammy Award-winner, Neal Merrick Blackwood, is fully orchestrated and features popular soloists Lisa Bevill and Terry Blackwood. Adult and children’s choirs are highlights of the rich musical interpretations.    Each of the ten songs featured on “Psalm Space” have been visually interpreted and are available on Peg Luke’s You Tube channel here: PegLuke'sYouTube (https://t.e2ma.net/click/nyd42b/neunlh/rds0ii)  This release comes on the heels of Peg Luke signing a distribution deal with industry leader New Day Christian Distributors.   “We are absolutely thrilled that our team at New Day Christian Distribution gets to help take the beautiful musical project “Psalm Space,” by internationally-known flutist Peg Luke to the retail market, said Dusty Wells, director of sales, New Day. “This gorgeous project resonates beauty and peace when listening to it - one of those rare projects that you can start playing and let it repeat over and over. ‘Psalm Space’ contains simple and beautiful music to soothe the soul.”  For more information visit: PsalmSpace (https://t.e2ma.net/click/nyd42b/neunlh/75s0ii) or NewDayDistribution (https://t.e2ma.net/click/nyd42b/neunlh/nyt0ii).   # # #  About Peg Luke  Peg Luke began learning piano at the age of five and flute at the age of seven. She has certainly carved out her own original journey, utilizing not only her flute skills, but her piano and compositional skills as well. Luke attended Northern Illinois University, where she quickly won the coveted Concerto Competition during her sophomore year. While doing her Doctoral studies at the University of Minnesota, British flautist Geoffrey Gilbert sensed her innate connecction to the instrument and advised her to ""go out and just play the flute.""  Peg Luke has done just that, performing at Carnegie Hall (12 solo flute recitals), Cadogan Hall, the National Flute Convention, and many more. Peg and her husband Jack spent more than a year in Nashville to pursue her dream project ""Psalm Space."" Not only is this project composed by Peg and inspired by her favorite Psalms, she is also a featured performer on ""Psalm Space."" Luke has been working with multi-Grammy Award-winning producer, Neal Merrick Blackwood on ""Psalm Space.""       1303 16th Ave. S. | Nashville, TN 37212 US  This email was sent to journal@csps.com.

Drawing heavily on neuroscience and current theories in sociology, the article “Why Love Can Help End Poverty and Inequality - and Save Planet Earth” looks at how love contributes to the ability to transcend one’s self and and act in support of a greater common good, and how the extreme stress resulting from environments devoid of love and empathy can lead to conflict, violence, greed and disregard for the natural environment.  It also highlights the steps we can take to transform our current social system -- based on domination and top-down hierarchies --  into one based on partnership and equity.

Boys Town Press recognizes the joys and challenges that communities and families face when helping to raise children. Their books for elementary- and middle school-aged readers are unparalleled in terms of providing entertaining guidance through these tough situations. Helping to confront a wide variety of challenging issues – anxiety, peer relationships, self-monitoring, stress – Boys Town Press titles rely on lively illustrations and relatable characters to make their stories fun and accessible.    Would you be interested in review copies of any of the below titles or an interview/contributed piece from any of the the authors?  · Parker Plum and the Journey through the CATacombs by Billie Pavicic, illustrated by Madeline Timm (August 6, 2019).

Image  Togo : Quand l'IFAD d'Elavagnon fascine le gouverneur Phil Bryant  Lomé, le 13 Août 2019-  ""J'ai vu un centre de formation remarquable et très formidable. Nous savons tous que l'agriculture et l'aquaculture sont très importants pour le développement d'un pays. C'est un centre qui a une technologie haut de gamme et vous devez en être fiers"". C'est la conviction de Phil Bryant après  avoir parcouru les différents compartiments de l'Institut de formation en alternance pour le développement (IFAD) en Aquaculture d'Elavagnon. En compagnie de Mme Yawa Tsegan Djigbodi, la Présidente de l'Assemblée nationale togolaise, de ministres et de la conseillère spéciale Reckya Madougou, ce mardi 13 août 2019, le Gouverneur de l'Etat de Mississippi est allé s'enquérir des réalités de ce centre inauguré en juin 2019 par le Président de la République Togolaise, Faure Gnassingbé.  A pas de charge, l'officiel américain a visité les bâtiments de l'internat, les étangs, l'écloserie, les équipements de pré grossissement et de grossissement, les appareils de transformation, le restaurant, la salle informatique et les salles de classe numérisées. ""Vous avez des technologies très avancées"", s'est exclamé Phil Bryant quand, dans l'une des salles de classe d'une quinzaine d'apprenants, il a été procédé à la résolution d'une équation mathématique à deux inconnues. Le problème posé portait sur un fait concret : un fermier qui devrait faire des calculs sur l'achat d'alevins. A ce niveau, comme à tous les autres, l'étonnement du gouverneur de l'Etat de Mississippi était grand.  Il sera davantage étonné quand le Ministre de l'agriculture, de la production animale et halieutique appuyé par d'autres personnalités, lui ont expliqué la stratégie dans laquelle s'inscrit la création de cet IFAD, le premier sur les dix prévus . D'ailleurs, le second est en construction dans le septentrion et sera consacré à l'élevage, a expliqué le Ministre Koutéra Bataka. Il a surtout développé la stratégie d'actions qui positionne les IFAD dans la réalisation des axes 1 et 2 du Plan national de développement 2018-2022.  A l'IFAD d'Elavagnon, les 60 apprenants en formation proviennent de toutes les régions du pays. L'appel à candidatures est déjà lancé pour recruter la deuxième promotion. L'idée étant de former le maximum de jeunes à l'aquaculture, un sous-secteur porteur, a fait savoir le directeur de l'IFAD d'Elavagnon.  Image  Vers la mise en place d’un mécanisme de prévention et de gestion de vulnérabilité liée au chômage et au sous-emploi au Togo  Lomé, le 13 Août 2019-  Le Ministère de l’action sociale, de la promotion de la femme et de l’alphabétisation a organisé ce mardi 13 août 2019 à Lomé, un atelier de réflexion sur l’état de vulnérabilité des jeunes liés au chômage et au sous-emploi au Togo.  Les travaux de l’atelier ont été ouverts par Koffi GANI, Directeur de Cabinet du Ministère de l’Action Sociale, de la Promotion de la Femme et de l’Alphabétisation.  Cette rencontre organisée en collaboration avec la Coalition nationale pour l’emploi des jeunes fait suite à une étude réalisée par le gouvernement en vue d’en savoir davantage sur la vulnérabilité des jeunes en situation de chômage.  Les résultats de cette étude qui ont fait l’objet de discussion au cours de cet atelier, serviront dans le cadre du projet de « mise en place d’un mécanisme de prévention et de gestion de vulnérabilité liée au chômage et au sous-emploi au Togo », qui constitue selon les organisateurs la première étape vers l’élaboration d’une politique nationale sur le sous-emploi et le chômage des jeunes au Togo.  Pour Pascal TCHILTEME, chargé de mission au Ministère en charge de l’Action Sociale, le Togo enregistre l’un des plus bas taux de chômage dans la sous-région. Mais des poches de vulnérabilité existent, impliquant des chômeurs de longue durée, des travailleurs en fin de contrat et de ceux ayant perdu leur emploi.  La démarche entreprise va donc permettre au Ministère en charge de l’Action Sociale, de consolider le développement social et renforcer les mécanismes d’inclusion comme le recommande le Plan National de Développement (PND) dans son axe 3.  Rappelons que toujours en faveur des jeunes sans emploi, le Ministère de la fonction publique a aussi lancé le 30 juillet dernier à Lomé, un nouveau projet dénommé, Programme d’adaptation professionnelle et d’aide à la création d’emplois.  Ce programme vise à promouvoir l’entrepreneuriat des jeunes ainsi que leur insertion dans la vie active. Il est dédié aux diplômés en quête d’emploi de longue durée et a pour spécificité, de les aider à créer leurs propres activités génératrices de revenus, ce qui pourra contribuer à diminuer le taux du sous-emploi dans le pays.  Image   Le siège de l’UNREC à Lomé abrite une formation sur la gestion efficace des armes et munition     Lomé, le 13 Août 2019-   Le Centre régional des Nations Unies pour la paix et le désarmement en Afrique (UNREC) a ouvert, lundi 12 août 2019 à Lomé, un atelier de formation de (04) jours à l'intention des praticiens du désarmement.  Cet atelier s'inscrit dans le cadre du projet « Désarmement, démobilisation et réinsertion » (DDR), qui vise à aider les professionnels du désarmement à gérer efficacement les armes et les munitions.  « Dans le cadre de leur travail, les experts du DDR sont amenés à travailler avec des ex-combattants qui parfois dans le cadre du processus de démobilisation ramènent des armes. Il convient donc que le personnel des Nations Unies soit entraîné et formé de façon adéquate pour une manipulation correcte de ce matériel qui peut être dangereux », a fait savoir Anselme YABOURI, Directeur de l'UNREC.  La formation est prévue en (02) deux phases. L'une théorique et l'autre, pratique. La partie théorique se déroule au siège de l'UNREC basé à Lomé du 12 au 14 août 2019 et la phase pratique est prévue pour les 15 et 16 août 2019 au Kofi Annan International Peacekeeping Training Centre (KAIPTC) au Ghana.  Cet atelier est conjointement organisé par le Département des opérations de paix des Nations Unies (DPO) et le Bureau des affaires de désarmement (ODA), avec l'appui financier de l'Ambassade de la République Fédérale d'Allemagne au Togo.  Image   La présidence de l’Université de Lomé dément les rumeurs sur l’augmentation des droits d’inscription à l’Université de Lomé       Lomé, le 13 Août 2019-   La semaine dernière, la présidence de l’Université de Lomé a communiqué les conditions pour bénéficier des nouvelles offres de formation en Licence professionnelle pour le compte de la prochaine rentrée.  Une sortie qui a suscité une polémique.  Ce mardi 13 août 2019, le président de l’Université de Lomé, le Prof Dodzi Kokoroko a tenu à démentir les rumeurs sur une possible augmentation des frais d’inscription des étudiants à l’Université de Lomé.  Dans un nouveau communiqué, Prof Dodzi Kokoroko précise que pour s’inscrire à l’université de Lomé pour le compte de l’année académique 2019-2020, les étudiants payeront les mêmes droits que ceux en vigueur l’année dernière.  « Les bacheliers désirant s’inscrire à l’université de Lomé en 2019-2020, en Licence professionnelle, paieront les mêmes droits d’inscription que ceux en vigueur au titre de l’année universitaire 2018-2019. Autrement dit, les droits d’inscription dans les anciennes Licences professionnelles restent sans changement », précise le document.  Toujours dans la note, le président de l’Université de Lomé précise toutefois que pour bénéficier des nouvelles offres de formation de Licence professionnelle qui s’ouvrent à compter de la nouvelle année universitaire, il faut débourser un peu plus.  « Seules les nouvelles offres de formation de Licence professionnelle prévues pour s’ouvrir pour compter de l’année universitaire 2019-2020, sont concernées par les nouveaux droits d’inscription tels que fixés par l’arrêté n° 113/UL/P/SG/2018 du 06 novembre 2018, fixant le montant des frais de formation professionnelle dans le grade de Licence à l’université de Lomé, notamment en son article 5 », explique le patron de l’Université de Lomé.  Les droits d’inscription annuels pour les nouvelles licences professionnelles sont fixés à 211.000 F CFA pour les étudiants, 321.000 FCFA pour les salariés et 576.000 FCFA pour les étrangers et zone hors UEMOA. Une mesure qui n’avait pas bien été comprise. D’aucuns avaient vite vu une augmentation exponentielle des frais d’inscription pour exclure les nouveaux bacheliers togolais. A noter que la prochaine rentrée pour les étudiants de l’Université de Lomé est prévue au mois d’octobre prochain.

5000g000028bvGcAAI,"Conspiracy Theories, by Quassim Cassim   -  (REVIEW COPY? INTERVIEW REQUESTS?)","Publishing November 8, 2019   ** ------------------------------------------------------------  9/11 was an inside job. The Holocaust is a myth promoted to serve Jewish interests. The shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School were a false flag operation. Climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese government.  These are all conspiracy theories. A glance online or at bestseller lists reveals how popular some of them are. Even if there is plenty of evidence to disprove them, people persist in propagating them. Why? Philosopher Quassim Cassam explains how conspiracy theories are different from ordinary theories about conspiracies. He argues that conspiracy theories are forms of propaganda and their function is to promote apolitical agenda. Although conspiracy theories are sometimes defended on the grounds that they uncover evidence of bad behaviour by political leaders, they do much more harm than good, with some resulting in the deaths of large numbers of people.  There can be no clearer indication that something has gone wrong with our intellectual and political culture than the fact that conspiracy theories have become mainstream. When they are dangerous, we cannot afford to ignore them. At the same time, refuting them by rational argument is difficult because conspiracy theorists discount or reject evidence that disproves their theories. As conspiracy theories are so often smokescreens for political ends, we need to come up with political as well as intellectual responses if we are to have any hope of defeating them.

5000g000028c6IBAAY,Editorial comments and corrections,"The following information was collected:  Name: John  Email: robledoint@yahoo.com  Subscriber: No  Subject: Game Over : New  FBI Data Completely Destroy Myths About Gun Homicide In The US  Product: csmonitor.com  Message: Game Over: New FBI Data Completely Destroys Myths About Gun Homicide In The US  (Tea Party PAC) – The most recent FBI data on crime statistics illustrates a pattern of homicide in our country that completely destroys the gun-grabbers’ narrative on firearm homicide.  More Americans were killed in 2017 with hammers and clubs than were killed with rifles of any kind.  And yet they want to ban our AR-15s?!  In September 2018, Breitbart News reported on the most recent numbers, those from 2017.  These figures showed that 467 people were killed by “blunt objects (hammers, clubs, etc.),” while 403 were killed with rifles.  And it must be noted that the category of “rifles” used by the FBI includes bolt action, pump action, single shot, and semi-automatic, as well as those the left describes as “assault weapons.” This means only a percentage of the 403 deaths attributed to “rifles” would have been carried out with an “assault weapon.” So the gap between the number of persons beaten to death with hammers and clubs verses those killed with “assault weapons” would be even greater than the gap between those who died in a hammer/club attack versus those who died being shot with “rifles” of any kind.  Breitbart News also reported that the 2017 crime figures showed 1,591 people were killed with “knives or cutting instruments” while 403 were killed with “rifles.” This means nearly four times as many people were stabbed to death as were killed with any kind of rifle. (The gap between the number stabbed to death and the number of persons explicitly killed with an “assault weapon” would be even greater.)  Meanwhile, Democrats are pushing a ban on “assault weapons” while Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (RINO-KY) says that legislation for such a ban would be “front and center” when the Senate reconvenes.  This week, US District Judge Josephine Staton of the Central District of California ruled that the Second Amendment does not mean that semiautomatic “killing machines” need to be legal in California.  Stanton’s ruling against “semiautomatic rifles with non-fixed magazines” came in response to a California Rifle and Pistol Association (CRPA) challenge on the state’s so-called “assault weapons” ban.  CRPA sought a summary judgement on the “assault weapons” ban on behalf of Plaintiff Steve Rupp, which was rejected by Stanton.  Instead, she characterized “semiautomatic rifles with non-fixed magazines” as “killing machines” which “are essentially indistinguishable from M-16s.”  The judge is clearly overlooking the fact that M-16s are fully automatic firearms, which can fire a full magazine of bullets per one trigger depression.  This is a huge difference from the AR-15, a semiautomatic rifle, which fire one round per trigger pull, and that’s all they’re capable of.  Her position is consistent with that of California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, who argued that “[a]ssault rifles may be banned because they are, like the M-16, ‘weapons that are most useful in military service’; and ‘they are also not “in common use” for lawful purposes like self-defense.’”  Stanton declared that a ban on M-16s can stand under scrutiny of District of Columbia v. Heller (2008), because these guns are “outside the scope of the Second Amendment.”  “Thus, if a weapon is essentially the same as the M-16, it is not protected by the Second Amendment merely because gun manufacturers have given it a different model number and dubbed it a ‘civilian rifle.’”  On July 11, 2019, Breitbart News reported a Florida homeowner used an AR-15 to stop four alleged intruders. He killed two and was shot and wounded by gunfire from the alleged invaders as well. On March 28, 2017, NBC News reported that a homeowner’s son used an AR-15 to fend off three alleged intruders and on May 13, 2014, Breitbart News reported that North Carolina homeowner used a AR-15 to defend himself against a suspect who kicked in the door of his house. Over nine million AR-style rifles were manufactured for U.S. sales during the Obama administration and ATF Associate Deputy Director Ronald Turk used a 2017 “White Paper” to explain that AR-15s are now the go-to gun for hunting, sport shooting, and other interests.  The Washington Post quoted Turk, saying, “The use of AR-15s, AK-style, and similar rifles now commonly referred to as ‘modern sporting rifles’ has increased exponentially in sport shooting. These firearm types are now standard for hunting activities. ATF could re-examine its 20-year-old study to bring it up to date with the sport shooting landscape of today, which is vastly different than it was years ago.”  The case is Rupp v. Becerra, No. 8:17-cv-00746 in the U.S. District Court for Central California.",8/14/2019 0:00,,,Junk,,,FALSE

5000g000028c6q8AAA,Amtrak and MassDOT Promote Rail Safety and Begin Test Runs for New Valley Flyer Passenger Train Service,"FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY  August 14, 2019    Amtrak and MassDOT Promote Rail Safety and Begin Test Runs for New Valley Flyer Passenger Train Service  Trains will travel on the Knowledge Corridor making stops in Greenfield, Northampton, Holyoke and Springfield    SPRINGFIELD, MA - Amtrak is announcing rail safety education efforts are underway as it begins running test trains in preparation for the launch of the Amtrak Valley Flyer<https://trainsinthevalley.org/valley-flyer/> pilot train service between Greenfield and Springfield, MA.    The two-year pilot Valley Flyer passenger train service, expected to begin at the end of August, will travel along the Connecticut River, a region referred to as the Knowledge Corridor, with trains making station stops in Springfield, Holyoke, Northampton and Greenfield. Amtrak currently runs service along this rail corridor, with its Vermonter train, which connects St. Albans, Vermont to Washington, D.C.    Through Friday, August 23, Amtrak will be running 1-2 round trips in overnight hours Monday through Fridays, leaving Springfield between 11:00 and 11:30 p.m., traveling to Greenfield and returning to Springfield at approximately 5:00 a.m. the next day.    With test trains now running and Valley Flyer service about to start, Amtrak officials and the Amtrak Police Department (APD) are alerting the public to be cautious, especially at grade crossings.    The team has given several presentations to various schools in the area, warning students to stay away from the tracks and right-of-way, while making sure they understand the meaning of railroad crossing signs and the stopping distances of trains. Parents have also received rail safety messages via district wide letters, automated phone calls and text messages, posts on district websites and school webpages, as well as including information in school newsletters.    APD has also been conducting positive enforcement grade crossing awareness events, where officers pass out literature at rail grade crossings educating motorists to approach with care, prepare to stop, look both ways and listen, and not to enter a crossing unless you can get completely through. Outreach efforts utilize material and rail safety information provided by Operation Lifesaver, a national non-profit organization dedicated to reducing railroad-related deaths and injuries.    The restoration of train service to the Knowledge Corridor is a project of the Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT).  # # #   CONTACT: Amtrak Media Relations Jason Abrams 212.630.6933 Jason.Abrams@Amtrak.com<mailto:Jason.Abrams@Amtrak.com>",8/14/2019 0:00,,,Junk,,,FALSE

Eisenhower, and ketchup magnate Henry Heinz in common? They are all of German descent. The German immigrant story is a long one - a tale of early origins, and continuous growth. Today, more than 44 million US citizens have German ancestry. To entice them to follow their roots back to Hamburg, Stuttgart, or Munich, the GNTB has launched a new campaign under the title GO (German Originality), which is part of the Year of German-American friendship, and has been launched in cooperation with the Goethe Institut and the BDI (Federal Association of German Industry).

""GO"" stands for ""German Originality"" and builds on the strong historical ties that have developed between the two countries, aiming to inspire Americans to travel to Germany. Some 44 million US citizens have German roots. The ""Year of German-American friendship"" was initiated in the US by the Federal Foreign Office in cooperation with the Goethe Institut and the BDI (Federal Association of German Industry). At the heart of the Year of Germany are dialogues, exchanges, the cooperation between people and cultures, and the development and expansion of networks. Germany Years demonstrate in which areas Germany and the respective host country can complement each other as partners, and work on the solution of critical future tasks. Under the title ""Wunderbar together,"" the Year of German-American friendship (October 2018 until December 2019) in the US underscores the unique significance of transatlantic relations with a bundle of projects in the areas of economics, politics, education, culture, and science. The campaign is supported through project funding by the Federal Foreign Office and the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi). Petra Hedorfer, CEO of the GNTB's board of directors, explains: ""With 6.7 million overnight stays, the US is by far the most important overseas source market for incoming German tourism. In our marketing campaign for the Year of German-American friendship, we see an excellent opportunity to give additional impetus to the continuing great interest in Germany as a travel destination."" The target group of the ""GO"" campaign are Americans with German roots in the Heartland of the US, as well as Millennials. Accordingly, the existing microsite ""German Originality"" under www.germany.travel/heritage was completely revised, user-generated content integrated, and a raffle incorporated. In the first two months, the campaign reached around three million people. Four US influencers explore aspects of their German origins, German-owned companies and brands in the US, and cultural influences of both countries. Their journeys address German immigrants, architectural history, influential Germans in the past, and German customs. The influencers share their content on the GNTB microsite as well as on their own social media channels. Also, the GNTB participates - with a sweepstake on branded IPads - in a pop-up tour of the Goethe-Institut, which is passing through selected cities in the US. With business conferences, science slams, art exhibitions, concerts, interactive activities for students, and panel discussions, the events offer distinct impressions of today's Germany. More than 20,000 attendees were welcomed on the first stop of the pop-up tour during Germany Week in Chicago (April 26 to May 5, 2019). More events will take place in Atlanta (September 24 to 28, 2019), and Portland (October 8 to 12, 2019). About the GNTBThe German National Tourist Board (GNTB) has its headquarters in Frankfurt am Main, Germany. It works on behalf of the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi) to represent Germany as a tourist destination and is funded by the Ministry in accordance with a decision taken by the German Bundestag. The GNTB develops and communicates strategies and products to promote Germany's positive image abroad as a tourist destination and to encourage tourists to visit the country. It has 31 agencies around the world to support its activities.

Our GM Alex has resigned to pursue a new career as a teacher and we want to wish  him the best. With his exit we have hired some new team members that will be starting over the next couple of weeks. In the meantime myself and other existing team members can help you if Alex has been your usual point of contact. Something I do want to address while I have your attention, is we get a lot of emails to place orders or request quotes, which is fine but it does leave a margin for  error, in that I myself will get an email, start to work on putting in the order  or send back a quote, get a call, get pulled away from my desk or any other number of reasons that my attention gets divided, resulting in the action not being completed and leaving your request unaddressed. If you do not get a response or get an order confirmation for an email you sent,  please follow up with us to ensure we do fulfill your request.  This is by no means an attempt to push you to our website to place an order if you are not comfortable doing so, you're always welcome to call us, come by or email us but the website  has a ton of resources, pricing and full online ordering, in fact all orders through TampaPrinter.com go through our site whether we put them in for you or you put them in on your own. We're very excited about our new team members and are confident that we will continue to provide you with great service (and maybe even better). Here are some discounts for you for taking the time to read my email: Take 10% Off The Following Products in August: Promo Code: rigid10 Wrapped Gator Boards [http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001X7EvtL8oA3pewxAXbFwnwk4o8rerOnkubugmojt0Sk0gDyTGNqyLyT3hcQqKCZBUJGdn0lLjK-tB2eEIcZWXO-BZKEumLpBv5X0AcXfuQO-dpdOoQ2FdccDBEgNswURU8SAi5Lt1zOiCijs4xjQIXcjFDj7s-fLLXbUJU3xokB95k81duZDSP4vy6EbH94wyDe-Y4dOoKQOqLN8vdLgwUtMzX5nxaYNn4N3PW98CaCBj3qZgZqvfD-fGd-MY7jx7&c=nmYV5LciBlbStheQo3r60MrE0_AO07Kyb7TZe3srcgoor0PUbJrjcg==&ch=YPkpqsW2FGcPB7OOPjq9uMy2z4eZ9zAcm1XAa3VnAy6ER8MZJKfqgw==] Mounted Posters/Signs [http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001X7EvtL8oA3pewxAXbFwnwk4o8rerOnkubugmojt0Sk0gDyTGNqyLyT3hcQqKCZBUllTp9d8ja0nLG0WX3c-WPRi3ORWGpZkl4k2__09B7tpnXQqGV3sGUoEonw4Ytjr-fP-GeA8hohZEV2DVAX_0ZLEa4iBxwHc6XsyScFIIzsCCdV8g9axEfL5JOGgJYdhxqBhS6gDDTysYCcOSFKxbdl5ygc9DayxDnRqwAPsOyOCm_tF8ST-YvRedXwBrO0mg&c=nmYV5LciBlbStheQo3r60MrE0_AO07Kyb7TZe3srcgoor0PUbJrjcg==&ch=YPkpqsW2FGcPB7OOPjq9uMy2z4eZ9zAcm1XAa3VnAy6ER8MZJKfqgw==] Stretched Canvas [http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001X7EvtL8oA3pewxAXbFwnwk4o8rerOnkubugmojt0Sk0gDyTGNqyLyT3hcQqKCZBUQAT2d-JeeW--yUgLapieMrLcOOK02PufPUrkFbL6MZ7sfpxvAZUVpU3deGcfyEGXhFXMxLsRhXSXb6r7njKwslSzGjftHVfVLGQGicJnDRQzIl88qi940QP1jGenqadVasxmUXU9v8seD12AHrOy9axz9SxejaefUO7_8QDP8xX91clfbo9CRA==&c=nmYV5LciBlbStheQo3r60MrE0_AO07Kyb7TZe3srcgoor0PUbJrjcg==&ch=YPkpqsW2FGcPB7OOPjq9uMy2z4eZ9zAcm1XAa3VnAy6ER8MZJKfqgw==] Full Color Yard Signs [http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001X7EvtL8oA3pewxAXbFwnwk4o8rerOnkubugmojt0Sk0gDyTGNqyLyT3hcQqKCZBULpvxxTuo-8diSiJG42NRpwoHdLX1rr0F_Emcnh6rwxqrfDEu1pOqGoBN9PrdRTspyyG3ETYsBNKyLWMvCg9oxHG6hy9nOj0AFEzFcW3f2deM8ylZ2sdM5ipUNSN3-uL2Z0hyWeBI8VESSo0HPHBTPLKGGj1CnPmUMiMa8kkJvHyqmJgcqJ9x7THppBDRrKDT&c=nmYV5LciBlbStheQo3r60MrE0_AO07Kyb7TZe3srcgoor0PUbJrjcg==&ch=YPkpqsW2FGcPB7OOPjq9uMy2z4eZ9zAcm1XAa3VnAy6ER8MZJKfqgw==] Discount Expired 8/31 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  STAY CONNECTED Like us on Facebook [http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001X7EvtL8oA3pewxAXbFwnwk4o8rerOnkubugmojt0Sk0gDyTGNqyLyY_ye27t9YvGNLBHYMwWGCvb5MOMoNGSNcaruAI5QQaqWAyTdjrwcwGdTeJQGSWz7s1Yx3-AESVgbVswS_uDCmWBdiF0M81QnnNM9Q1L3VfbI-Zk-xGWXE3GzQ0SND5x7O2m4JJaDncHAIEHnON3csw=&c=nmYV5LciBlbStheQo3r60MrE0_AO07Kyb7TZe3srcgoor0PUbJrjcg==&ch=YPkpqsW2FGcPB7OOPjq9uMy2z4eZ9zAcm1XAa3VnAy6ER8MZJKfqgw==]    Find us on Google+ [http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001X7EvtL8oA3pewxAXbFwnwk4o8rerOnkubugmojt0Sk0gDyTGNqyLyY_ye27t9YvG-P-jdJMIhgguj04GLr9_ftT5-V00lKvwGPDsaW4z33qPnb_HLDuFMdZAXf3vuLONzyx3gziGwbDpDKdfWrmVhj-pvMtd1R66uDddvQ5Edb49_BxUlrQyr55JSWHjdyNZyq8uZcL7yvM=&c=nmYV5LciBlbStheQo3r60MrE0_AO07Kyb7TZe3srcgoor0PUbJrjcg==&ch=YPkpqsW2FGcPB7OOPjq9uMy2z4eZ9zAcm1XAa3VnAy6ER8MZJKfqgw==]  View on Instagram [http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001X7EvtL8oA3pewxAXbFwnwk4o8rerOnkubugmojt0Sk0gDyTGNqyLySXne0piu5fbOy0WhLy1Y1aB_NyCRwLm6SvWxzDc5MWEFbp2tf5PGdHavvdrRaqns9rZEbQV6E502pNvyLo8yulGPkvbjv0FZ2ggIhyrAB1bi7krpKjBt2gareMF2lslJZOMTQq19GsY&c=nmYV5LciBlbStheQo3r60MrE0_AO07Kyb7TZe3srcgoor0PUbJrjcg==&ch=YPkpqsW2FGcPB7OOPjq9uMy2z4eZ9zAcm1XAa3VnAy6ER8MZJKfqgw==]   Find us on Yelp [http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001X7EvtL8oA3pewxAXbFwnwk4o8rerOnkubugmojt0Sk0gDyTGNqyLyeG6LiDZ2f_tl1tkUzXO2Emt-QjhrppR7E1ZerV0IQ0r2tTGSz6f0l7xE6ge4kBLayKmd3XwMqtvVgy5zK4KhtvtNMQISahe-423q-XRAmp0GS117H0XDjeMIW1beqYq73phP0YZ0C8U3-DfgilBhRM=&c=nmYV5LciBlbStheQo3r60MrE0_AO07Kyb7TZe3srcgoor0PUbJrjcg==&ch=YPkpqsW2FGcPB7OOPjq9uMy2z4eZ9zAcm1XAa3VnAy6ER8MZJKfqgw==] ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Forward this email http://ui.constantcontact.com/sa/fwtf.jsp?llr=wknh45uab&m=1122025846102&ea=$info@christianscience.com$&a=1133025621236  This email was sent to info@christianscience.com by will.c@tampaprinter.com.

I want people to get along, you know, just be who you are, own it and move on from the moments you couldn’t live in.”  Her first collaboration with producer Jay Joyce, Wildcard moves from fraught, taut rock & roll to gentle folk, classic Wurlitzer country and a bit of funky gospel with Lambert’s signature wit and tongue-in-cheek humor permeating throughout.  The Grammy Award winner celebrated today’s announcement by releasing the latest peek inside the project – “Bluebird,” which she co-wrote with Luke Dick and Natalie Hemby. The album also features “infectious” (Billboard), Top 25 lead single “It All Comes Out in the Wash,” as well as recently-released “foot-stompin’ barnburner” (NPR) “Locomotive” and “crunchy, frisky jam” (Stereogum) “Mess with My Head.” Additional album details will be revealed soon.

As I explain in the book, the dream of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and the civil rights pioneers has been thwarted. Black America has not reached the ""Promised Land."" Instead, we have been led astray by failed policies and opportunistic politicians.  Some people can only see the results, not the causes. Thus, we have seen the development of a kind of racialist politics, where the charge of racism is used as both a weapon against every political opponent and a shield against all criticism. This was the thinking behind Don Lemon's attack on me when I refused to call President Trump a racist.  It's also the kind of thinking that I'm trying to correct in A Dream Derailed (http://adreamderailed.com/?mc_cid=caaf49c4fa&mc_eid=[UNIQID]) .  A Dream Derailed (http://adreamderailed.com/?mc_cid=caaf49c4fa&mc_eid=[UNIQID])  combines memoir and history with a call to action for all Americans. In it, I suggest that we leave behind the concept of racism, as it holds us back from achieving God's plan.  We're in the final edits of the book now and getting ready for printing. After that, we'll be distributing the book and embarking on a tour to promote A Dream Derailed and the prescriptions in it.  Of course, this is a very exciting time for us. I've had lots of inquiries about where to get the book, whether it will be available in large quantities, on Amazon, and so on.  I promise you that we are doing everything we can to make it as widely available as possible.  Because we are so close to publication, this is your last chance to  become a sponsor (https://secure.anedot.com/coalition-of-african-american-pastors-usa/dream-derailed-sponsors?mc_cid=caaf49c4fa&mc_eid=[UNIQID])  of A Dream Derailed. We're very close to our goal for publication and distribution of the book - just a few more sponsors will put us over the top.  Don't miss this chance to become a sponsor - all it takes is $100.  Everyone who gives $100 or more will be given a signed copy of A Dream Derailed and will be listed on our Sponsors page.

At the moment, the tour is still in the planning stages, but I will be sending out more details as it gets closer.

Among other achievements, Peg Luke has performed 12 sold-out Carnegie Hall flute recitals.  The deeply spiritual music of “Psalm Space” was created to bring soul-nourishment to the masses. Purposely written using the French Taize technique, the sound creates a calming effect and gives listeners a chance to meditate, heal, emote kindness and peace. The work is meant to inspire relaxation and restoration, whether driving home from a hectic day at work or suffering a tragic loss.   “Psalm Space exists to bring hope and healing to people who need encouragement. Throughout the entire process, I quickly became aware of the power of this music to touch and help people,” Luke says. “It’s my gift to the world, and I am very grateful for all the people that made this vision a reality.”  “Psalm Space” was produced by multi-Grammy Award-winner, Neal Merrick Blackwood, is fully orchestrated and features popular soloists Lisa Bevill and Terry Blackwood. Adult and children’s choirs are highlights of the rich musical interpretations.    Each of the ten songs featured on “Psalm Space” have been visually interpreted and are available on Peg Luke’s You Tube channel here: PegLuke'sYouTube (https://t.e2ma.net/click/nyd42b/fs3plh/rds0ii)  This release comes on the heels of Peg Luke signing a distribution deal with industry leader New Day Christian Distributors.   “We are absolutely thrilled that our team at New Day Christian Distribution gets to help take the beautiful musical project “Psalm Space,” by internationally-known flutist Peg Luke to the retail market, said Dusty Wells, director of sales, New Day. “This gorgeous project resonates beauty and peace when listening to it - one of those rare projects that you can start playing and let it repeat over and over. ‘Psalm Space’ contains simple and beautiful music to soothe the soul.”  For more information visit: PsalmSpace (https://t.e2ma.net/click/nyd42b/fs3plh/75s0ii) or NewDayDistribution (https://t.e2ma.net/click/nyd42b/fs3plh/nyt0ii).   # # #  About Peg Luke  Peg Luke began learning piano at the age of five and flute at the age of seven. She has certainly carved out her own original journey, utilizing not only her flute skills, but her piano and compositional skills as well. Luke attended Northern Illinois University, where she quickly won the coveted Concerto Competition during her sophomore year. While doing her Doctoral studies at the University of Minnesota, British flautist Geoffrey Gilbert sensed her innate connecction to the instrument and advised her to ""go out and just play the flute.""  Peg Luke has done just that, performing at Carnegie Hall (12 solo flute recitals), Cadogan Hall, the National Flute Convention, and many more. Peg and her husband Jack spent more than a year in Nashville to pursue her dream project ""Psalm Space.""

5000g000028bs3xAAA,Tom Steyer Reaches Donor Requirement for September Debate,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 CONTACT: press@tomsteyer.com Tom Steyer Reaches Donor Requirement for September Debate Just five weeks after announcing his candidacy, Steyer surpasses the DNC donor threshold and is only one qualifying poll away from September debate stage in Houston  (SAN FRANCISCO, August 13, 2019) — Today, candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination Tom Steyer hit the 130,000 individual donor threshold required to reach the Democratic National Committee September debate stage. Steyer met the donor requirement within just five weeks of entering the race, averaging over 26,000 donors a week.  “Since entering the race five weeks ago, our priority has been getting Tom’s message out to the American people,” said Campaign Manager Heather Hargreaves. “Tom reaching this milestone just five weeks into his campaign is proof that his message is resonating with people across the country.”  As the American people learn more about Tom, support for his campaign has rapidly increased, including gaining over 48,800 donors in the last week alone. The campaign has invested in a strong digital program to reach voters, and the strategy is working.  Steyer is now just one qualifying poll away from making it onto the September DNC debate stage in Houston, TX. In only a few weeks, Steyer has surpassed candidates who have been in the race much longer, in polling from Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina. Steyer has been steadily gaining traction in early primary states, as indicated by three qualifying polls in Iowa and South Carolina, the most recent of which, from Monmouth University, had the candidate polling at 3%. Other non-DNC sanctioned polls show Steyer joining the top tier of Democratic contenders. Last week, Morning Consult (https://morningconsult.com/2020-democratic-primary/) had Steyer polling at 6% in early states, beating Pete Buttigieg and within striking distance of Kamala Harris. A new Change Research Poll (https://www.changeresearch.com/nevada-poll-august-2-8-2019) has Steyer at 3% in Nevada, besting Beto O’Rourke.  Paid for by Tom Steyer 2020.  ###  About Tom:  Tom Steyer left his successful investing business seven years ago to give his own money and all his time and energy to fighting for progressive causes. He soon became one of the country’s leading forces in registering more young voters and voters of color, fighting climate change, working for racial justice, and helping secure better lives for all Americans. Tom has led a number of people-first, grassroots campaigns that have repeatedly defeated powerful special interests, beating big oil to win clean air laws, forcing big tobacco to pay its share of healthcare costs, and closing a billion-dollar corporate tax loophole to fund public schools.  Tom and his wife Kat Taylor were early signers of the Giving Pledge, a commitment to give the bulk of his fortune to good causes before they die. Tom’s dedication to doing what is right comes from his parents. His father was a lawyer who prosecuted Nazis at the Nuremberg Trials; his mother was a journalist and teacher who volunteered to teach prisoners in New York City jails. Tom says his parents showed him the power of having the courage to do the right thing. Their greatest lesson, he says, was that our actions speak louder than our words – what we do is more important than what we say.  ============================================================ Tom Steyer 2020 | P.O.

However, the poll also found that about 35% of those surveyed say they are still unfamiliar and uneducated concerning CBD products.  This information proves that CBD is booming, especially among millennials, however it also shows that a big chunk of adults are unfamiliar with exactly what it is and what it can help with. Which leads to the pressing question: With the explosion of CBD, why are so many people still uneducated?  If interested for a “CBD 101” story and where we currently stand with legislation and FDA progress, I represent CANNOVIA (https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/wf/click?upn=84Em28S1K9SvtzcUtu04EhO2mmcknxIlloRBICyG-2F5s-3D_6pchHAirW10eM8b14ZAlkZkRllITHdt0G4CIxpgEX-2FYMT-2FVtvkhkoxOwXdc140hQDKip1v9w6NG6f4yMNdzd3I0JbBoOspHl9BOjIgd0xs3DCHCWULMMsI0o0nUAnzsqtC7LG2qH0if83TQOduYTxwzheob7DFCy8OcRzVIf2bSBq1w19QcGrmvSHRb4j0fxqzY4K47-2FboB-2FEEbLAcKOb-2FlIKg8z79aYjmYjCnVu4LJpgll64gipS78YA9uF0efi7e2wkuYES2HT6vgtAuEu2qQCzOaaFoezkODoq11R6DUSgyVkKHc9W9z47aAM1QwdgUdA6DBjnFfA0WWiKyZmzi5zGijPvYyrfqsHjD-2F1ogk-3D – a CBD industry leader and can offer the CEO, Brian Baum, along with medical expert, Dr. Pat Hezmall who can comment on the below:  · New poll results: is it surprising millennials are leading the CBD consumption craze? · Why is there so much confusion and misinformation in the CBD industry? Does it have to do with lack of FDA regulation and enforcement? · What is legal and illegal when it comes to CBD? · The importance of quality product and how consumers can ensure they are getting their money’s worth · Potential benefits: what are the potential medical benefits that consumers are seeing with CBD? · More  Please let me know if you’d be interested in covering this new poll or any of the above story bullet ideas.

5000g000028c2SlAAI,"FOLLOWING UP: RE: NEW CLIENT: BioCorRx – Offers Safe and Effective, Live-Saving Implants to Treat Those with Addiction Disorders","Hi Stephanie???,  Hope you are well! I wanted to follow up and see if you would be interested in a story about the BioCorRx naltrexone implant and/or speaking with CEO and Founder of BioCorRx Brady Granier. I look forward to hearing your thoughts.   Best,  Nandi  ------------------------------------------------------------  Hi Stephanie???,  I wanted to reach out and introduce you to a new client I’m representing, BioCorRx – a leading edge healthcare solutions company focused on improving the lives of those struggling with alcohol and opioid addiction.  BioCorRx has developed a sustained-release naltrexone implant which is used to inhibit cravings associated with the utilization of alcohol and opioids. Naltrexone has been approved for use as a tablet, to help thousands of patient fight their addictions, in the United States since 1984. While the drug is very effective to treat addiction, some physicians have observed that the recommended dosage form and efficacy of the drug can present obstacles that can affect the treatment process for addicts especially in the critical early stages. Medical experts have found that the use of a long-acting naltrexone implant presents a way to overcome the hurdles that may arise with the use of the commercially available dosage forms of the drug.  Image  To further discuss BioCorRx and the innovative naltrexone implant, CEO and Founder Brady Granier, is available to be interviewed.  Warmest,  Nandi  About BioCorRx:  BioCorRx Inc. (OTCQB: BICX) is an addiction treatment company offering a unique approach to the treatment of substance abuse addiction. The BioCorRx® Recovery Program, a non-addictive, medication-assisted treatment (MAT) program, consists of two main components. The first component of the program consists of an outpatient implant procedure performed by a licensed physician. The implant delivers the non-addictive medicine, naltrexone, an opioid antagonist that can significantly reduce physical cravings for alcohol and opioids, and can prevent opioid overdose following relapse. The second component of the program developed by BioCorRx Inc. is a Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) program tailored specifically for the treatment of alcoholism and other substance abuse addictions for those receiving long-term naltrexone treatment. The Company also conducts R&D under its controlled subsidiary, BioCorRx Pharmaceuticals.

5000g000028cDsnAAE,Levi-Strauss: A Biography  (REVIEW COPY? INTERVIEW REQUESTS?),"** ------------------------------------------------------------  Academic, writer, figure of melancholy, aesthete – Claude Lévi-Strauss (1908-2009) not only transformed his academic discipline, he also profoundly changed the way that we view ourselves and the world around us.  In this award-winning biography, historian Emmanuelle Loyer recounts Lévi-Strauss’s childhood in an assimilated Jewish household, his promising student years as well as his first forays into political and intellectual movements. As a young professor in 1935 Lévi-Strauss left Paris for São Paulo to teach sociology. His rugged expeditions into theBrazilian hinterland, where he discovered the Amerindian Other, made him into ananthropologist. The racial laws of the Vichy regime would force him to leave France yetagain — this time for the US in 1941, where he became Professor Claude L. Strauss, toavoid confusion with the jeans manufacturer.  His return to France, after the war, ushered in the period during which he produced his greatest works: several decades of intense labour in which Lévi-Strauss reinvented anthropology, establishing it as a discipline that offered a new view on the world. In 1955, Tristes Tropiques offered indisputable proof of this the world over. During those years, Lévi-Strauss became something of a national monument, a celebrity intellectual in France. But he always claimed his perspective was a “view from afar,” enabling him to deliver incisive and subversive diagnoses of our waning modernity.  Loyer’s outstanding biography tells the story of a true intellectual adventurer whose unforgettable voice invites us to rethink questions of the human and the meaning of progress. Lévi-Strauss was less of a modern than he was our own great and disquieted contemporary.  The Author:  Emmanuelle Loyer is Professor of Contemporary History at Sciences-Po, Paris. Her biography of Lévi-Strauss was awarded the Prix Femina essai in 2015.   Reviews  “The inspiration that continues to spring forth from the work of Lévi-Strauss is a mystery to many anthropologists. He has told us of the many influences on his work and commentators have argued for yet others but they don’t really account for his extraordinary originality and independence. Emmanuelle Loyer’s thorough account of his life and work may help us resolve this wonderful puzzle.” Maurice Bloch, London School of Economics  ""Emmanuelle Loyer has produced a meticulously-researched, intelligent, and sensitive biography worthy of her subject, one of the greatest Francophone intellectuals of the 20th century. Critical yet generous, her portrait of Claude Lévi-Strauss rings true and comes alive on the page.""

5000g000028cDrVAAU,Hong Kong's Democracy Dilemma,"What's Next: Expert takes on the issues shaping tomorrow's news  No Images?  Click here https://hudsoninstitute.cmail19.com/t/i-e-pijuiit-otljknj-e/  Members of the medical profession gather to protest against Hong Kong police brutality at Queen Elizabeth Hospital on August 13, 2019 in Hong Kong. (Getty Images)  Hong Kong has entered its 10th week of demonstrations protesting the erosion of individual freedoms and extension of China's security apparatus. Will protesters succeed in their efforts to ""reclaim Hong Kong,"" or will Beijing and Chief Executive Carrie Lam crackdown on the movement once global attention has shifted? Below, Hudson Institute experts examine what's at stake for Hong Kong, China, and the world.  What's Next: Consequences of a Beijing Intervention  Hudson experts on the possible consequences if Beijing forcibly intercedes:  Patrick Cronin: [https://www.hudson.org/experts/1259-patrick-m-cronin]  “A violent crackdown on Hong Kong protesters would catalyze anti-China sentiment abroad and bolster hardline support for the Chinese Communist Party at home, accelerate ‘mainlandization’ by assimilating Hong Kong into the Greater Bay Area, undermine economic growth, have a chilling effect on relations across the Taiwan strait, and trigger economic sanctions from the United States and others.”  John Lee: [https://www.hudson.org/experts/576-john-lee]  “This would be disastrous for China’s standing and Hong Kong’s status as a secure global financial centre. A financial catastrophe and exodus precipitated by violence committed by Chinese authorities would be a humiliation for the Party and perhaps even an existential political moment for Xi Jinping.”  Robert Spalding: [https://www.hudson.org/experts/1265-robert-spalding]  ""A crackdown would have severe ramifications for China’s economy. Hong Kong is China’s window the western capital markets. Many of the Chinese stocks are sold through dollar denominated American Depository Receipts issued in Hong Kong. Many congressional members have begun calling into question the continuation of the special relationship in light of China’s failure to adhere to the one country two systems agreement made when Hong Kong reverted to PRC rule.  It may be that the protests will slow once the school year starts. Given the enormous damage to China’s economy caused by losing its window to the West, the PRC will try to delay a crackdown as far into the fall as possible. However, they would most likely not want protests going on during their October 1st National Day of the People's Republic of China.""  5 Key Takeaways from the Protests  From Hudson expert  John Lee [https://www.hudson.org/experts/576-john-lee]'s latest article for The Australian, "" China Squirms in Global Spotlight on Hong Kong [https://www.hudson.org/research/15228-china-squirms-in-global-spotlight-on-hong-kong]"":  What’s fueling the protests: Beyond the extradition bill, the demonstrations are about the broken promise of genuine universal suffrage (Beijing maintaining its ability to hand-pick the chief executive and other candidates), police violence, political prisoners and the erosion of freedoms promised by China in its 1984 treaty with the UK and which is enshrined in its Basic Law.  A troubling trend: Since 2007, China’s annual spending on domestic security has tripled to about $300 billion, which is one-fifth more than it spends on the People’s Liberation Army.  Citizen suppression: In Xinjiang, China’s domestic security spending has increased ten-fold, from $1.15 billion in 2007 to more than $12 billion by the end of last year. Tibet and the Qinghai Province (with its one-quarter Tibetan population) have had similar increases.  Hong Kong’s future: Hong Kong will likely continue to be only a ritual democracy where people can vote but the leaders must first secure Beijing’s approval. In the best-case scenario, the erosion of freedoms will be be halted temporarily.  Looking to Taiwan: China has long used Hong Kong as proof it was sincere in offering Taiwan significant autonomy and permission to retain its own armed forces under a special “one country, two systems” deal with Taipei upon unification. Developments in Hong Kong ends any chance Taipei will take Beijing at its word.  Want to learn more?

For boys growing into men, never understanding emotion can lead to a lifetime of negative consequences such as: anxiety, anger issues, and violent behavior,” says Dr. Pierre-Louis, founder of the new Doc and Jock, LLC (https://docnjock.com/about-us) . “We need to start changing this narrative by helping men openly talk about their experiences at every life stage.”  Available for interviews, Q&As, and bylines, Dr. Pierre-Louis can discuss:  · How to prevent violent and aggressive behavior by teaching teens how to cope, understand and express their emotions at an early age · Empathy Matters: Why it’s vital to place a greater emphasis on teaching empathy—especially to young men · How Doc and Jock, LLC is offering resources for young men in foster care, orphanages, juvenile detention centers, and mentor programs · Men and women don’t experience the same event the same way—how to best address this divide and encourage a more open conversation  Please let me know if you’re interested in speaking with Dr. Pierre-Louis and/or receiving a copy of her new book, Richard and the Boyz: The Puberty Experience. Thanks for your time, Stephanie. I look forward to hearing from you!

5000g000028bxQFAAY,The first step in trying to conceive: prenatal vitamins,"Hi Stephanie?,  Doing best by your baby is no easy feat from avoiding sushi to exercising regularly, not to mention that you’re inundated with conflicting advice and product options. One of the first decisions you’ll make for you and your baby is which prenatal vitamin to start taking. But, with countless options to consider – organic, chewable, gummies, with iron, without iron – how are you supposed to choose?  Mary Jane Minkin, MD, OB/GYN at Yale University is available to discuss her recommendations for prenatal vitamins and conditions that might be irritated by common ingredients.  Please let me know if you'd like to speak with Dr. Minkin.  Thanks!

5000g000028brtTAAQ,Data Reveals: Salary Needed to Afford Rent in Neighborhoods Worldwide,"Hi Rosalee,I have a new data-driven study which I believe may be of interest to you and your readers, revealing how much you need to earn to afford to live in some of the most in-demand neighborhoods around the globe. The results include data for neighborhoods or districts in Boston. This dataset is for immediate release and the press release can be found below. If you have any questions, or would like an exclusive quote, interview, or access to more data, please do not hesitate to contact me. If you think this index would be of interest to a peer, please feel free to pass on my message.Thanks very much,Kind regards, Ricky SuttonPress Relations Manager______________Sweet Spot PRw: sweetspotpr.com  e: ricky@sweetspotpr.com If you do not wish to receive future communications from Sweet Spot PR, please let us know by clicking here.NestpickFor Immediate ReleaseHow Much Do you Need to Earn to Live in Neighborhoods Around the Globe?Data shows the minimum salary required to live in some of the world’s most in-demand neighborhoods, revealing the gap in affordability and equalityCity of London ranks as the most expensive neighbourhood in the index, in terms of salary needed to afford rent, followed by Monte-Carlo, Carré d'Or and Condamine, Port in Monaco, who also have the most expensive rent price per square foot for a single person apartment, at $8.39 and $10.36 respectively. The most expensive neighborhoods in terms of minimum salary required to afford a single person apartment are located in Monaco, Seoul, Bermuda and San Francisco.Bermuda and Shanghai have the biggest inequality gaps between rent price and local affordability, with an individual on minimum wage required to work 977 hours and 825 hours respectively in order to pay for one month’s rent. The city with the biggest disparity in inequality and affordability is Montreal, Canada, where the prices in Vieux-Montréal are more than double the average, at 222%, while renters in Ahuntsic Cartierville pay only 45% of the median price in the city. Berlin, Germany, January, 2019 - Furnished apartment experts Nestpick has released The 2019 Neighbourhood Price Index, revealing how much an individual must earn in order to afford rent in over 700 neighborhoods around the world. From first-hand experience helping thousands every year to relocate from abroad, Nestpick realised that many highly-skilled workers moving to new cities mainly focus on their new salary, without much understanding of the local rental market and how it will impact their disposable income. For example, most Tech employees working in Silicon Valley for big companies like Facebook and Apple have to live hours away from their office due to exorbitant rental prices, despite higher than average salaries. The real estate experts wanted to create an index which revealed the real on-the-ground costs available today, looking at the global apartment rental market from a neighbourhood approach. The results offer movers real insight into how much money someone would need to earn in order to settle into various neighborhoods in some of the most in-demand cities around the world, as well as where the gap of affordability and inequality is most apparent.

After a string of duets with such greats as Merle Haggard and Moe Bandy, Fricke landed a solo recording contract in the early 80's and scored several hit singles, including ""Don't Worry 'Bout Me Baby,"" ""He's a Heartache"" and ""You're Heart's Not In It."" She won CMA's coveted ""Female Vocalist of the Year” in 1983 and '84 and has been nominated for three Grammy Awards. She has been credited with over 1,600 album projects and scored 36 hit singles.

 ABOUT E!’S REVENGE BODY WITH KHLOÉ KARDASHIAN  The third season of “Revenge Body with Khloé Kardashian” features a new group of men and women finding the strength to prove to themselves, and those who have been negative forces in their lives, that they’re worthy of love and respect.  With the guidance of model, TV personality, mom, and author of the New York Times bestselling book “Strong Looks Better Naked,” Khloé Kardashian, joined by her premier group of health, beauty, and style experts, will give these individuals the encouragement they need and the help they desire to become better versions of themselves, for themselves.  This season, audiences will once again take a powerful journey alongside participants as they turn their pain into empowerment through their emotional and physical transformations.  With the help of Khloé and their devoted trainers, participants’ uplifting stories will highlight their struggle, resilience, and ultimate redemption.  Returning this season are celebrity trainers Ashley Borden

What happens when you face a brow emergency? There is no better expert to turn to for advice than Umbreen Sheikh, a licensed cosmetologist, and founder + CEO of Wink Brow Bar and Salon in New York City.  Problem: Overplucking your brows  Almost every woman has gotten too close to that magnifying mirror and been overzealous with a tweezer. Umbreen says, “Don’t fear. You can fake it till you make it with subtle makeup tricks that will help to create the illusion of a fuller, thicker brow. This can be done with Wink’s own Brow Perfecting Quad.”   https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/wf/click?upn=G62jSYfZdO-2F12d8lSllQB8WI2oyZfG5qJI3L7h4N2WxmS-2F1a0yWtz4xkZmHX4EGLVGYsJQkdnOdXf3BEwC6umi04ETTMc65-2BYgb9JAkHVwjm0X5gZjWOr0sGP39hrjoH_6pchHAirW10eM8b14ZAlkZkRllITHdt0G4CIxpgEX-2FYMT-2FVtvkhkoxOwXdc140hQDKip1v9w6NG6f4yMNdzd3I0JbBoOspHl9BOjIgd0xs1Sy83Va2ALI8ZT73zxEQAsSQT2kWUHvBprX46uWgyPGxJ8jdrQdhmEigsnoQIMO1XHeBYIo0JEuc3cEQUplLNKdlV1abj0KLxLQbTXxz41NgELGIEH1zF8hCElJ6qGTYF8CAL-2BNmbRS5HoPbQsHVsSXIN8Y2YqNgJc4WyoFWtOovMDUZTh45nzxWjQxmpUAfh-2BCh1fs5lVKv5xjb67ZruwE3kOJXDDDAXjrhdw9DnPuj3y3WDs4lfZPcwitNZjt8w-3D Brush the two powders through, then brush through again to blend for a natural-looking finish. Finally, use a highlighter to camouflage any random hairs. Umbreen says that “Drawing a straight line under your brow will help minimize the appearance of strays.  This will also lighten and brighten the entire eye area, drawing more attention to the eyes.”  Problem: Creating a too wide eyebrow gap  The obvious solution to this is to fill in the points closest to the bridge of the nose to lessen the gap. This can be done via microblading. Microblading is a semi-permanent tattoo technique used to create the illusion of fuller brows. With this method, Umbreen can create almost any look and shape.  First, Wink technicians consult with clients about the best brow shape for their face and choose a color that matches the natural hair color and skin undertone. The brow area is then cleaned and numbed for the treatment. Instead of using a tattoo machine, a handheld tool manually draws hair strokes. This all can take up to 30 to 40 minutes.  Results can last anywhere from one to three years, depending on your skin type (the ink fades faster on oily skin), products, and lifestyle. It’s also an ideal procedure for women who have lost brow volume due to age, menopause or chemotherapy.  Problem: Unruly Brows  Bold, feathery brows are in, but messy is an adjective you never want to be associated with your arches. “If your brow hairs are “wonky,” you need a game plan for controlling them,” says Umbreen.   If your arches do need a trim, Umbreen suggests brushing your brows up towards the top of your ear with a spooly brush and cutting only the tips off the long hairs pointing the scissors down, (not parallel to the brow). ""This gives trimmed brows a natural look, because none of the hairs are exactly the same length,"" As a finishing touch, mist a spoolie with hairspray and brush it through brows—directing the hairs up for a lifted look.  Problem: Matching your brow color to your hair exactly  In the case of the hair on your head and your eyebrows, you “don’t want to match the curtains to the carpet,” says Umbreen.  Very often, a hair colorist will suggest that you tint your brows much lighter if you are going blonder. Umbreen disagrees with this. “Darker brows will act as a frame for the face and enhance your eye color. Generally, it will give you the appearance of a lot more brow.” If you have gone too light or too dark, “eyebrow tinting is the process of applying semi-permanent dye to enhance, shape, and define your brows. This can be done at salons such as Wink. “It gives the appearance of thicker, more youthful-looking brows,” says Umbreen. An average session takes only about 15 minutes and the color should last anywhere from 3-6 weeks. It’s instant gratification as your new eyebrow color will be immediately apparent.  Problem: Plucking brows too short  Eyebrows that are too short can make your eyes and nose look too big. If you have plucked them or waxed them so that you look like you have half an eyebrow, of course, you can spend the time to pencil them in every day but that is time-consuming and takes skill to make both brows symmetrical. Or… you could get eyebrow extensions. Similar to eyelash extensions, eyebrow extensions are done with tiny fibers of mink or synthetic hairs. The brow extension fibers are then attached to either bare skin or to existing hairs, giving them a fuller, stronger look. The service is from 25 mins to 90 mins depending on the thickness or amount of work required.  The Problem: You’re so squeamish for waxing or you bruise easily  You would be hard-pressed to find a woman who enjoys the tear of a strip of wax against her eyelid to remove tiny eyebrow hairs, but yet we put up with it in the name of beauty.  For anyone who has ever deviated from their regular waxer on a vacation or business trip, you have most likely ended up being cut or bruised by overly aggressive waxing.  There is a great alternative for everyone called organic threading. As Umbreen explains, “With its origins in Asia centuries ago, eyebrow threading is a simple process that is often considered to be one of the most painless (and least invasive) options for shaping brows. The threading process is simple and typically involves a single piece of cotton thread, After wiping the eyebrow area clean with alcohol, the thread is ""twisted and pulled along areas of unwanted hair acting like a mini-lasso, lifting the hair directly from the root without the use of any chemicals or unnecessary tugging on delicate skin. As opposed to waxing, tweezing, or lasers, threading is considered one of the safest and most precise methods of hair removal, especially in the delicate areas surrounding the eye. ""Threading allows our specialists to have greater control over which hairs are removed.” The technique is also ""100 percent natural,"" which means there are no artificial waxes, chemicals, or invasive techniques used during the procedure.  Problem: You've made your brows too big and bold.  Don’t assume you have to wash it all off. Instead, take a cotton swab dipped in makeup remover and carefully trace your brow’s natural outline. Remember, brow product should be applied within the brow’s hairline, not beyond it. Cotton swabs will remove any unwanted shading that has ventured too far outside the lines.  Problem: Trying at home to make both eyebrows symmetrical  This is one of the most common mishaps that Umbreen hears from clients who tried to ‘go it alone at home.’ Umbreen offers, “When you obsess over making your eyebrows look exactly the same, you can wind up over-plucking them.  Too-thin brows are much worse than ones that are just a tad different. Your eyebrows are supposed to be sisters, not twins.

Umbreen jokes that her mother taught her, “The birds, the bees and the brows."" Growing up, Umbreen spent much of her time in her mother’s salons while also attending University at King’s College London and graduating with a degree in Biomedical Sciences.  After marrying in 2003, Umbreen moved to New York where she became PR Director of a niche magazine.  In 2005, Umbreen had a son, and in 2011 her daughter was born. After her children were in school, she decided to fulfill her lifelong passion for beauty, brows and product development.    While living in New York, she realized that there were no brow salons that catered to threading and focused on understanding face shapes and how to achieve the perfect brow shape in a way that did not damage the eye area.  Although many salons offered waxing, this was not a method Umbreen wished to pursue.  She was dismayed by existing salons that offered one size fits all, unhygienic, or painful brow/eyelash treatments.  As someone who learned the reigns of beauty and brows from an entrepreneurial mother, the concept of women’s “Embrowerment” was essential to Umbreen. In 2014, she developed the concept for Wink. Today, her empire includes three Wink Brows Bars in Manhattan, one in Brooklyn and one in London.  For those who can’t make it to the salon, Wink has an eponymous line of the brow, lash and facial products available for purchase online.  Philanthropic pursuits play a significant role in Umbreen’s life. She is a committee member of “Developments in Literacy” that educates 27,000 girls in Pakistan. She is also a Lotus Circle Advisor for The Asia Foundation a non -profit international organization that works across Asia advancing the rights and opportunities for women through their empowerment program.  Umbreen resides in New York with her financier husband and two children.    ______________________  If you would rather not receive future communications from KMR Communications Inc., please go to https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/wf/click?upn=xiLcdm-2FJO7lnRqLN5to6StmKWrtvG2-2Bdtok10uA7l7Qr6Gop5xGgr3DCpTyt6K2qBLkyPg8ryai7lmOKcz7U-2BPpvTx9rzPCk-2FrCGs0aNed6COL4KN5rf7xJrb0msn6-2BV1R3VRoivzeLCNtJgQmkvl-2FAHRff71TTI5OWoMXaL9TdrvT9A3kMrmuDH8G28Y4el_6pchHAirW10eM8b14ZAlkZkRllITHdt0G4CIxpgEX-2FYMT-2FVtvkhkoxOwXdc140hQDKip1v9w6NG6f4yMNdzd3I0JbBoOspHl9BOjIgd0xs1Sy83Va2ALI8ZT73zxEQAsSQT2kWUHvBprX46uWgyPGxJ8jdrQdhmEigsnoQIMO1XHeBYIo0JEuc3cEQUplLNKdlV1abj0KLxLQbTXxz41NkncRd-2BlI8XRlrvRoNOTzRuM3lP3J6W3dfmlRwYj6JcQVwTo3Maieoewn1IOBPwOwhOL1-2Bo3vb-2Fcrmq-2FSCdC60MdY0E-2B5mgzdKgTVhzjAj1urePEVWH8tZQsdulP7NJA6tdk53bhN-2BdSwa5xxvP-2FUNs-3D  KMR Communications Inc., 419 Park Avenue South Suite 406, New York, NY 10016 United States  --  To unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to customerservice+unsubscribe@csps.com.",8/12/2019 0:00,,,Junk,,,FALSE

5000g000028c9eSAAQ,[Press Release] Lux Research Forecasts $10.7 Billion Market Opportunity in Metamaterial Devices,"The World’s Top 4 Ride-Hailing Companies Are Worth More Than $166 Billion Shared Mobility Poised to Disrupt Multitrillion-Dollar Auto Industry  BOSTON, MA – August 8, 2019: The rise of shared mobility services like Uber and Lyft is threatening to disrupt a multitrillion-dollar industry. Self-driving cars, zero-emission vehicles, connectivity, and innovative materials are defining the future of mobility. To guide innovation and investment in the mobility space, the team at Lux Research, a leading provider of tech-enabled research and advisory services for technology innovation, took a deep dive into the business models and themes disrupting this age-old industry in the new report, “Sharing is Scaring: New Business Models Disrupting Mobility.” (https://web.luxresearchinc.com/e2t/sc2/Mm-nFbjZ2yqW9dXxCF7wRSmbW79V3ry6THSkQW6B8Qgn62WShQf1FXffT03 )  “Our reliance on owning a car has created one of the largest industries in the world. Today, however, our relationship with the automobile is changing as new business models aim to replace conventional car ownership with a combination of ride-hailing and vehicle-sharing accessed through mobile apps – a trend we call shared mobility,” said Chris Robinson, Senior Analyst and lead author of the report.  “Recently, two key changes are emerging in this space. First, shared mobility companies are pursuing integration of many services and transportation modes, such as bikes and scooters, into one platform rather than developing one specific app or business model. Second, the industry’s growth is attracting a diverse array of competitors, including automakers, transportation network companies, and tech companies.” Robinson noted that the shift from pursuing a single business model, which characterizes Shared Mobility 1.0, to Shared Mobility 2.0 is providing opportunities for new competitors.  Transportation network companies like Lyft and Uber are no longer startups. The top four ride-hailing companies in the world – Didi, Uber, Lyft, and Grab – have a combined valuation of $166 billion. “These companies,” Robinson continued, “are no longer focused on expanding into new markets with ride-hailing services; most markets are already saturated with such options. Instead, multimodality – providing access to different modes of transport, such as bikes and cars, on their platforms – is now a key focus.”  The new Lux report (https://web.luxresearchinc.com/e2t/sc2/Mm-nFbjZ2yqW9dXxCF7wRSmbW79V3ry6THSkQW6B8Qgn62WShQf1FXffT13 ) presents several case studies to highlight how different sectors are creating strategies to develop shared mobility platforms, finding that no single industry is best-positioned to own this future. It also finds that autonomy and integration of public transport into shared mobility platforms are two key differentiators in the future of shared mobility, which will ultimately help drive these new business models to profitability.  The report deems autonomous vehicles the most important technical development shaping the future of shared mobility. “Despite the disruptive promises of shared mobility, no companies have been able to maintain profitability,” notes Robinson. “Autonomous vehicles promise to drastically alter the financials of ride-hailing.” Navigating this change will be crucial for success, especially as shared mobility companies’ competitors have more experience in fleet management.  Lux’s “Sharing is Scaring: New Business Models Disrupting Mobility” report delves deeper into these strategies and case studies, providing advantages companies can leverage and challenges they must overcome.

Keep a consistent sleep schedule – Make sure you wake your kids up and have them go to bed at about the same time on weeknights and weekend nights. Bedtime and wake time should not differ from day to day by more than an hour.  1. Establish a regular, relaxing bedtime routine - Make the 30 minutes before bed wind-down time. Do not let children watch TV, use electronic devices (smartphones, tablets, etc.) or exercise during this time. Instead, have them do something relaxing, such as playing with quiet toys, reading a book or listening to soothing music.  1. Create an environment in your kid’s room that is only for sleeping – This means kids’ bedrooms should be comfortable, quiet and dark. Make sure the bedroom is not too warm (keep it 74 degrees or lower), as warm temperatures interfere with sleep. It is also very important to get all technology, including TVs, cell phones, computers, tablets, etc., out of the bedroom.  1. Make sure your family is eating regular meals throughout the day and having a light snack before bed - Do not feed kids large amounts of sugar or chocolate just before bedtime.  1. Children should exercise regularly, but not too close to bedtime - The best time for kids to exercise is first thing in the morning or in the late afternoon. If possible, they should avoid strenuous physical exertion right before bedtime.  1. Let kids enjoy the sunshine in the morning – Make sure your kids have the opportunity to spend time outside every day, especially in the morning, as exposure to sunlight or bright light helps keep the body’s internal clock on track.  1. Limit your children’s light exposure in the evening, especially after dinner - Dim overhead lights and reduce the brightness of screens.  1. Avoid putting kids down for naps if they are having trouble falling asleep at bedtime - Naps are developmentally appropriate in young children, and some adolescents benefit from a short afternoon nap (30-45 minutes right after school).  1. Do not allow kids to consume caffeine after 4 p.m. or within six hours of bedtime - Caffeine has a half-life of four to six hours, which means it should still be helping you stay awake four to six hours after you take it. Consuming caffeine too close to bedtime makes it hard to fall asleep.  1. Be mindful of teenager’s unique sleep clock - If you have teenagers in the house, keep in mind that most teens’ biology will not allow them to fall asleep any earlier than 10:30 or 11 p.m. And teens need eight-10 hours of sleep per night.  As a lead researcher on sleep and fatigue in children undergoing cancer treatment and brain tumor survivors, sleep is a major focus for Dr. Crabtree’s work.  She recently spoke at a TedX Talk (https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/wf/click?upn=G62jSYfZdO-2F12d8lSllQB0EkkfiL-2FRh3yUZZj7WJzVbzG1v5ueAvGcDEjg7CeL-2F59hvzTzSL8uhD2E4tlSXEM44wyOK31sANMCn2hX0jYbPISm1zelKDUMLVJOa7GMhN7DURJiLP3-2Bz0XpButLwlkQ-3D-3D_6pchHAirW10eM8b14ZAlkZkRllITHdt0G4CIxpgEX-2FYMT-2FVtvkhkoxOwXdc140hQDKip1v9w6NG6f4yMNdzd3I0JbBoOspHl9BOjIgd0xs3pLSZqc0y-2BOjmQcgYRv5dEO7k9n5QKXGgitzdjAvIIlcnCWzxZIZzfpqAS4D70lk09aZvQSBj4yRZfDp8w8CqAoKoEeelzN-2B9ev8MZR43wC6L6ccnh5oR-2FoCvDCRbgLCo2PeOXBDupHRJap7eS5z-2BGL2s4fyZBSo9wwUupZKIu160tYvug6ZTsQgTg4daliEVFUy1vtucNY-2BKLF0mGIRXn9W0Mvr8GNrJOK2TozQ0KaHaVKO-2B5R7dK6TzQ4SnMZWI-3D in Memphis on how very early school start times are detrimental to the health of teenagers as well as those around them.  Dr. Crabtree underscores how insufficient sleep in kids and adults contributes to making us overweight, sick and sluggish.   “Sleep is the third pillar of health, along with nutrition and movement, that keeps us healthy and balanced. Yet, as a society, we really undervalue the role of sleep in keeping us healthy,” said Dr. Crabtree.  ** To Speak with Dr. Crabtree, please contact Katy Hobgood Ray at 901-595-0564     ------------------------------------------------------------  # # #  St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital (https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/wf/click?upn=G62jSYfZdO-2F12d8lSllQB8pBJtPqkpprIHSF-2F92IAYo-3D_6pchHAirW10eM8b14ZAlkZkRllITHdt0G4CIxpgEX-2FYMT-2FVtvkhkoxOwXdc140hQDKip1v9w6NG6f4yMNdzd3I0JbBoOspHl9BOjIgd0xs3pLSZqc0y-2BOjmQcgYRv5dEO7k9n5QKXGgitzdjAvIIlcnCWzxZIZzfpqAS4D70lk09aZvQSBj4yRZfDp8w8CqAoKoEeelzN-2B9ev8MZR43wCwYSCnkSw-2FTZ-2F4FYfi81pwfw-2FTHUwYwUjMmZHnbA2SiJiTl33GNt47Da1fAqCD6Hdf-2FHT0VV-2FqWFj8wqWwOBzx6KJuFkGB5IL3deaUuvurmej-2BIhiIMrdCw0v-2FiTj3gjrJEppvDgdWFGPN0OnsQFSMk-3D is leading the way the world understands, treats and cures childhood cancer and other life-threatening diseases.

5000g000028cBLcAAM,"Celebrating the universal bond of food in an Italian immigrant family, ‘Feast of the Seven Fishes’ - November 2019","                                     FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:        powerHouse Books is pleased to announce the November 2019 release of        Feast of the Seven Fishes:       A Brooklyn Italian&#39;s Recipes Celebrating Food and Family       by Daniel Paterna       Introduction by Michael Lomonaco, Contribution by John Turturro              ""A powerful meditative reflection in photographs and interviews on the emotional connections—food, family, neighborhood—between Italy and America, Feast of the Seven Fishes illuminates the deep cultural bond between our immigrant elders and their children."" –John Turturro              In Feast of the Seven Fishes: A Brooklyn Italian&#39;s Recipes Celebrating Food and Family, Daniel Paterna takes you on magical journey into a hidden world. Through recipes handed down in his family, stunning photos taken by the author himself, and three-generations of memories, Paterna reveals the soulful, humorous, and always delicious history of Italian-Americans in Brooklyn.              Paterna is the real deal, a second-generation Italian-American, whose family has preserved their culture from the shores of Naples to the streets of Bensonhurst. He&#39;ll show you how to make long-forgotten recipes like stuffed calamari and he&#39;ll take you to the stores, restaurants, and bakeries where artisans are still doing things the old way.              This is an intensely personal book that powerfully illustrates the essence of the American experience: the ways food, family, and memory are preserved and changed by the immigrants who brought them to our shores, and the children of those immigrants who keep the flame alive.               Daniel Paterna has created some of television&#39;s most recognizable images; during his career, he has worked with leading content brands including ABC News, AMC, A&E, Disney, ESPN, History, and PBS, earning awards from such institutions as PRINT, Communication Arts, and Promax/International Broadcast Design Association. His design for NBC&#39;s coverage of the 1996 Olympics won him an Emmy from The National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences. Paterna was born and raised in the house his grandfather built in Brooklyn, graduated from The Pratt Institute with honors in graphic design, and currently heads his own Brooklyn-based design group. His photography has been on display at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, and the 440 Gallery in Brooklyn.              A native New Yorker, Chef Michael Lomonaco has spent his career celebrating the bounty of the American table at some of the city&#39;s most iconic restaurants including 21, Windows on the World, Wild Blue, and Guastavino&#39;s, before opening Porter House in 2006. Lomonaco is also one of the original Food Network and Travel Channel chef personalities with his shows Michael&#39;s Place and Epicurious. Fans can still catch him on TV today, as he makes regular appearances on ABC&#39;s The Chew, and The Today Show, among others. Along with Porter House Bar and Grill, Michael is the chef and partner of Center Bar, the sophisticated cocktail lounge also located on the 4th floor of the Time Warner Center.              John Turturro is an actor and director whose notable film credits include Do the Right Thing, Barton Fink, Quiz Show, The Big Lebowski, The Truce, O Brother, Where Art Thou?, and Mia Madre. He is the director of six films, including Mac, which was honored with the Caméra d&#39;Or at the 1992 Cannes Film Festival, and the upcoming Going Places. On stage, he has appeared in Danny and the Deep Blue Sea, for which has was awarded an OBIE, and Italian-American Reconciliation, La Puta Vida, The Bald Soprano, Steel on Steel, The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui, and End Game. Turturro is also known for his television roles on Monk, for which he won an Emmy, and most recently HBO&#39;s The Night Of, for which he was nominated for a Golden Globe and a SAG award.

5000g000028c3zMAAQ,Keto diet and vaginal health confusion continues,"Stephanie?,  The Keto Diet may seem like the rage right now- but what about the “Keto Crotch?” As diet trends continue to constantly change, women might not be fully aware of how these fads can begin to affect their body and overall vaginal health.  Lauren Streicher, MD, Medical Director of the Northwestern Medicine Center for Sexual Medicine and Menopause and Clinical Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine is available to discuss the importance of balanced diets in correlation to vaginal health and provide insight into how to get rid of an 'off' smell down there.  Let me know if you’d like to speak to Dr. Streicher about the “Keto Crotch”.

As I explain in the book, the dream of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and the civil rights pioneers has been thwarted. Black America has not reached the ""Promised Land."" Instead, we have been led astray by failed policies and opportunistic politicians.  Some people can only see the results, not the causes. Thus, we have seen the development of a kind of racialist politics, where the charge of racism is used as both a weapon against every political opponent and a shield against all criticism. This was the thinking behind Don Lemon's attack on me when I refused to call President Trump a racist.  It's also the kind of thinking that I'm trying to correct in A Dream Derailed (http://adreamderailed.com/?mc_cid=caaf49c4fa&mc_eid=[UNIQID]) .  A Dream Derailed (http://adreamderailed.com/?mc_cid=caaf49c4fa&mc_eid=[UNIQID])  combines memoir and history with a call to action for all Americans. In it, I suggest that we leave behind the concept of racism, as it holds us back from achieving God's plan.  We're in the final edits of the book now and getting ready for printing. After that, we'll be distributing the book and embarking on a tour to promote A Dream Derailed and the prescriptions in it.  Of course, this is a very exciting time for us. I've had lots of inquiries about where to get the book, whether it will be available in large quantities, on Amazon, and so on.  I promise you that we are doing everything we can to make it as widely available as possible.  Because we are so close to publication, this is your last chance to  become a sponsor (https://secure.anedot.com/coalition-of-african-american-pastors-usa/dream-derailed-sponsors?mc_cid=caaf49c4fa&mc_eid=[UNIQID])  of A Dream Derailed.

5000g000028c519AAA,I need a Fiscal Sponsor,"Greetings, My name is Stefanie Torres. I am writing to you because I need a Fiscal Sponsor for my United4US Campaign. I am aspiring to raise funding to open and operate several new Homeless Shelters throughout Philadelphia PA and Camden NJ. Trouble is, my Ministry is not yet incorporated nor does it have tax exempt status. Please visit    https://united-4-us.net I have been reading and resonating with Christian Science for many years. I haven't had much of a chance to get actively involved with any of the Reading Rooms or the Church itself due to my instability. I've been homeless myself, off and on, since the year 2000. I'm temporarily living in a rooming house and in the process of hopefully purchasing a home. I'm praying that all goes well with that. I communicate with God and my Spirit Guides as well as my Angels daily. Through that kind of communication I was given this assignment which eventually led to my Campaign. If you read about my Campaign on my website you will see that what I am called to do, I couldn't have come up with that on my own. It was Divinely given. I want to get this moving before the winter. So if you at least consider helping me with my Campaign by becoming my Fiscal Sponsor, I will greatly appreciate it. Many Blessings. Stefanie. I can also be reached @: 1(267) 317-8854 any time after 10 a.m. If you have any questions.",8/14/2019 0:00,,,Junk,,,FALSE

5000g000028cPxcAAE,"Cup of Joe, issue 4 - campaign update","CUP OF JOE  August 17, 2019  Newsletter  It’s been a busy seven days - from the Iowa State Fair in Des Moines and the 1st Congressional District Passport to Victory event in Central City through parades and county and local Democratic Party gatherings in Iowa, all the way to a great Cup of Joe on the Issues forum in Corning, Iowa.  And lots of great press besides!  My grassroots team - leafleting Iowa!  I couldn’t do any of this without my staff and volunteers.   They’re the ones who organize my events, get me where I need to go, get me on TV and radio and in the press, and make sure everything runs smoothly.   They’re also working hard to make sure as many people as possible hear my message. I run in every parade I can, and attend every event I can - but without my staff and volunteers, I couldn’t reach nearly as many people.  We do politics the old-fashioned way - with leaflets and handshakes. Now we’ve given out over 100,000 brochures. And people are starting to notice…  https://twitter.com/JoeSestak/status/1161361457021407232  Iowa State Fair  The State Fair is one of the great events of the summer here in Iowa. I was able to meet the Drake University women’s soccer team for a chat on cancer, and had a walk-around with the American Wind Energy Association - check out my Twitter, Instagram and Facebook for more pictures.  I also spoke at the Des Moines Register Soapbox - where I talked about why I’m running, my decades of service to this country and what I learned about accountability from it. Watch the whole 20-minute speech below.  https://youtu.be/Bk6CHKza_Zs  Cup of Joe on the Issues, Corning, Iowa – agriculture and “training for a lifetime”  Corning, Iowa, hosted our fourth “Cup of Joe on the Issues” event - on agriculture, food, and how we can train our workforce for a lifetime. We talked about the fact that America spends less on workforce training than any other developed country - and why that has to change if we want to help our farmers and rural communities face the challenges of tomorrow. If you’d like to read more on my plans for “training for a lifetime” please read my policy paper here.  https://www.joesestak.com/issues/jobs-economic-protection/  I spoke to Local 5’s Sabrina Ahmed about my campaign in Iowa - and how I plan to win.  CLICK HERE TO WATCH  https://www.weareiowa.com/news/local-politics/2020-candidates/running-in-2020-joe-sestak/  We meet some great people in Iowa. Here are two who’ve been great to us - Araceli and Ivan.  https://twitter.com/JoeSestak/status/1162056080844894208  Vox called me a “maverick” and said”He’s an anti-establishment Democrat who has beaten a Republican in a Republican district, he’s someone with military and foreign policy experience, and he has a deeply personal reason for his approach to health care reform: This is his record and he’s running on it.” You can read the full profile here.  https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/8/13/20680106/joe-sestak-2020-presidential-campaign-policies-admiral-navy-specter-obama-medicare-public-option  I’ll be speaking at events across Iowa, from a town hall in Des Moines on Saturday, August 17th, and the 7-County Democratic Rally and Fundraiser in Otley on the 18th, through local Democratic Party events to the Iowa AFL-CIO. I’ll also be traveling to San Francisco for the Democratic National Committee’s summer meeting, where I’ll be speaking.

The report, which updates a 2014 CAP report on the same topic, details the escalating conflict between Turkey and the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) since a ceasefire between the two parties fell apart in 2015.  The report examines the reasons behind the breakdown of the earlier peace process; the current contours of the conflict; as well as the domestic and regional dynamics at play. After assessing the still-distant prospects of a shift in Turkish policy, the report lays out the steps necessary to move toward a path of accommodation. The steps include:  · Begin a confidence-building approach toward Kurdish political actors, including in Syria, to secure a ceasefire · Release political prisoners and ease domestic repression to elevate non-PKK interlocutors · If a prospective ceasefire holds, lower tensions through stepped social and political gestures before negotiating directly with the PKK  “A confluence of domestic political, military, and regional factors raises the slight hope of a softening in Turkish policy toward the Kurds,” said Max Hoffman (https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/wf/click?upn=G62jSYfZdO-2F12d8lSllQBz0p3GHQFP2ojSfiVbdB9oDeRWaOcKW2SZ5wyBlDWQqY-2FjCdei4vF6J0-2BAEt-2F2KWkqYmLYt9joKnBFKStR3tvJc-3D_6pchHAirW10eM8b14ZAlkZkRllITHdt0G4CIxpgEX-2FYMT-2FVtvkhkoxOwXdc140hQDKip1v9w6NG6f4yMNdzd3I0JbBoOspHl9BOjIgd0xs0sreLDRPshfRReNwgDfdaHp-2F3oC5GUeWAdqkWlVJsfvrgTTwgk-2Bksmmn-2BpQu3sF3ReXfGaEa2HNcXYRa5U5dpYZlNPAbWzLsUrBfHKo29-2FUK5UvJkrWjHABJDts8i8ezzMvs2PJwSvQsQTaoKDFobe5dHPq2-2BXjO4Z-2FeCCkh0yaYQZm5TTUbxRjtenUs1at2JUoCfWXqhaq6OL-2F4OdNIuef5XNaUHMq4h6Vrzvqh26ifir2afx8HAK39tjNr1EiRk-3D , associate director of National Security and International Policy and author of the report. “Over the decades, this conflict has oscillated between peaceful and violent chapters. It remains to be seen whether we are about to enter an easing phase. But a path of accommodation could yield important political and economic benefits for Turkey and remains the only chance for a lasting peace.”  Read the report: “The State of the Turkish-Kurdish Conflict (https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/wf/click?upn=G62jSYfZdO-2F12d8lSllQBz0p3GHQFP2ojSfiVbdB9oBb52xyZbu6rB7UDOnQ8t-2BB76d5ONE-2B5F8-2BJLaPRjqxScIExIBU0XB0p-2FRwUjxsO8LYgZcwliMfdP2sVzlGHQpcfNGesa6bui4vvHjIeYZdVOzZDkhYkJ-2B2-2F34iu8lEcFc-3D_6pchHAirW10eM8b14ZAlkZkRllITHdt0G4CIxpgEX-2FYMT-2FVtvkhkoxOwXdc140hQDKip1v9w6NG6f4yMNdzd3I0JbBoOspHl9BOjIgd0xs0sreLDRPshfRReNwgDfdaHp-2F3oC5GUeWAdqkWlVJsfvrgTTwgk-2Bksmmn-2BpQu3sF3ReXfGaEa2HNcXYRa5U5dpYZlNPAbWzLsUrBfHKo29-2FUJlf5tdlqO6tgRFcghy-2Fy31c0SideRxJY7XBNbjX-2B8iNZKc4nAx4simm4KE-2FwZtZzzEtNAn6rjR70fsmwOS190ErQq1Stm2TSGp1Pl8YirQW6nmTsl8ZaDzPH9FnHUuSiioZEwWLwkJtrtVMK5ugx08-3D ,” by Max Hoffman.

5000g000028biVbAAI,Prayer & Praise Newsletter,"** Dear Leader, ------------------------------------------------------------ It's been a very hot August in Wales, one of the hottest we can remember.  We decided not to book a holiday as finances were tight, and anyway, there was lovely weather here.  A few days out over August at various parks and a couple of friends coming to stay has been the order of the day.  Reuben has had a great school report at the end of term, coming on really well with his reading, spelling and writing - we are of course proud parents of our little boy.  The picture is of Reuben and Rebekah (not sure whose driving!) at a park we visited last week in West Wales.  On the ministry front, it was lovely to catch up with Andrea Willams the CEO of Christian Concern who was speaking in Wales recently.  We spent a couple of hours chatting through some of the cases they are dealing with.  One thing that really jumped out in our conversation is the increase in the way Christians are being marginalised or persecuted for their own beliefs within our Country.  We continue to pray for the vital work Andrea and her team are doing at www.christianconcern.com  https://www.christianconcern.com  Some good news was that we had our first Encourager Series booklet back from the printers.  This will form part of a wide series of booklets we're planning to produce across, The Encourager Series, The Understanding Series, The Recovery Series, The Kingdom Series and The Spotlight Series.  There's a lot of work ahead of us in this but we're hearing of a general lack of teaching and discipleship, covering the basics of Christianity.  These 28-page booklets will be a brilliant tool for Churches across the country to use as study helps within small groups.  The first one Encourager Series : Prayer Life (http://www.petersbrook.com) is now in stock (we had over 130 pre-orders) and we have The Understanding Series : The Trinity (http://www.petersbrook.com) .  Although this is a lot of work to get things done, I'm really excited that these new Christian Help Guides (http://www.christianhelpguides.com) are coming into being.  A worthwhile project for new and existing Christian Alike.  http://www.petersbrook.com  Thank you if you have sent in a gift to support our ministry work.

They tell Republicans to “do the right thing” and “get something done.”  Lost in the noise, however, is what exactly should be done. And even more important, why.  For many politicians, Democrats and Republicans alike, gun control proposals are nothing more than cheap attempts to politicize tragedy. The most recent statistics from the FBI explain why.  But first, some background.  A pair of horrific shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, last weekend brought several controversial policy proposals into the spotlight.  TRENDING: State Wants To Be Able To Take Your Car Away if You Go 5 Miles over Speed Limit  Perhaps chief among them is the so-called “assault weapons” ban, a measure that would ban “military-style” semi-automatic rifles — and which is favored by an overwhelming number of Democrats.  In fact, nearly every Democrat running for president in 2020 has voiced support for such a ban, according to Vox.  But would a weapons ban really decrease mass shootings — or violent crime in general? At least one major study suggests it would not.  According to the RAND Corporation, “evidence for the effect of assault weapon bans on mass shootings is inconclusive.” Similarly, “evidence for the effect of assault weapon bans on total homicides and firearm homicides is inconclusive.”  Do you think an assault weapons ban would help prevent mass shootings? Yes No Completing this poll entitles you to Conservative Tribune news updates free of charge. You may opt out at anytime. You also agree to our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use. A ban would be not only ineffective, but also misdirected.  The most recent available statistics from the FBI indicate that when it comes to murder, rifles are far from the most common weapon.  In 2017, rifles accounted for 403 murders in the United States. By contrast, “knives or cutting instruments” accounted for 1,591.  And when’s the last time we heard about a ban on knives? (OK — in all honesty, it was pretty recently, in Britain.)  In America, however, calls for knife bans are rare, and rightly so. But the reason for politicians’ silence on knives is more sinister.  RELATED: Anthony Scaramucci Compares Trump to Nuclear Disaster, Says GOP Might Need To Replace Him  As a pragmatic matter, legislation banning knives would be politically useless.  Proposing a ban on “assault” rifles is a much more effective strategy. Calling for a ban on scary-looking weapons is viscerally appealing and emotionally satisfying.  But if major studies and federally collected data are any indication, an assault weapons ban would do little good.  We are committed to truth and accuracy in all of our journalism.

The Outdoor Power Equipment Institute (OPEI) (http://www.opei.org) , an international trade association representing small engine, utility vehicle and outdoor power equipment manufacturers and suppliers, reminds home and business owners that it’s best to get ready before a storm strikes.  “In the rush right before the storm, people sometimes forget to make sure their outdoor power equipment is in order,” said Kris Kiser, president and CEO of OPEI. “They also run out of time as weather is often unpredictable. At all times of the year, it’s important to keep your equipment in working order, have the right fuel on hand, and know where your safety gear is. This is doubly true during storm season.”  OPEI offers the following tips to help homeowners and businesses plan ahead for storm clean-up:  Make a list of what you need to clean up. Survey your property. Consider the damage a storm might cause and make a list of what tools might be needed for repairs. You might need a chainsaw, pruner, generator, or utility type vehicle.  Take stock of your outdoor power equipment. Make sure equipment is in good working order. If needed, take your equipment to an authorized service center for maintenance or repair.  Find your safety gear.  Avoid the scramble for sturdy shoes, safety goggles, hard hats, reflective clothing and work gloves, which should be stored in an accessible area with your equipment.  Review the owner’s manuals for your equipment. Read product manuals to ensure you know how to operate your equipment safely.  Have the right fuel on hand. Fuel stations may be closed after a storm, so it’s important to have the proper fuel for your equipment. Store your fuel in an approved container. Use the type of fuel recommended by your equipment manufacturer. It is illegal to use any fuel with more than 10% ethanol in outdoor power equipment (for more information on proper fueling for outdoor power equipment visit www.LookBeforeYouPump.com (http://www.lookbeforeyoupump.com) ).  Remain calm and use common sense when using outdoor power equipment. Clearheaded thinking and smart decision-making can help you make smart choices. This is no time to rush. Take time to think through a strategy for clean-up efforts.  Use safety precautions. Be aware of fundamental dangers that can occur. For instance, chainsaw kickback, which may happen when the moving chain at the tip of the guide bar touches an object, or when the wood closes in and pinches the saw chain in the cut. Always stand with your weight on both feet, and adjust your stance so you are angled away from the blade. Hold the chainsaw with both hands. Never over-reach or cut anything above your shoulder height. Always have a planned retreat path if something falls.  Keep firm footing when using pole saws and pole pruners. Keep a firm footing on the ground. Observe the safety zone, which means keeping bystanders and power lines (those above you and any that might have fallen down) at least 50 feet away from your work area.   Ensure portable electric generators have plenty of ventilation. Generators should never be used in an enclosed area or placed inside a home or garage, even if the windows or doors are open. Place the generator outside and away from windows, doors, and vents that could allow carbon monoxide to come indoors. Keep the generator dry and do not use it in rainy or wet conditions. Before refueling, turn the generator off and let it cool down.  Drive Utility Type Vehicles (UTVs) with caution. Keep the vehicle stable and drive slowly. Do not turn the vehicle mid-slope or while on a hill.  Be aware of others. Keep bystanders, children and animals out of your work area. Do not allow other people near outdoor power equipment, such as chainsaws, pole saws or pole pruners when starting the equipment or using it.  Pay attention to your health. Storm cleanup can be taxing on the body and the spirit. Do not operate power equipment when you are tired or overly fatigued. Drink plenty of water and take regular breaks.

5000g000028cOHAAA2,Security Notice. Someone has access to your system.,"Hello!  I am a hacker who has access to your operating system. I also have full access to your account.  I've been watching you for a few months now. The fact is that you were infected with malware through an adult site that you visited.  If you are not familiar with this, I will explain. Trojan Virus gives me full access and control over a computer or other device. This means that I can see everything on your screen, turn on the camera and microphone, but you do not know about it.  I also have access to all your contacts and all your correspondence.  Why your antivirus did not detect malware? Answer: My malware uses the driver, I update its signatures every 4 hours so that your antivirus is silent.  I made a video showing how you satisfy yourself in the left half of the screen, and in the right half you see the video that you watched. With one click of the mouse, I can send this video to all your emails and contacts on social networks. I can also post access to all your e-mail correspondence and messengers that you use.  If you want to prevent this, transfer the amount of $500 to my bitcoin address (if you do not know how to do this, write to Google: ""Buy Bitcoin"").  My bitcoin address (BTC Wallet) is:  3QdHFhfbMqMQcTVHbxj1HeTQyR6TBYFaUm  After receiving the payment, I will delete the video and you will never hear me again. I give you 50 hours (more than 2 days) to pay. I have a notice reading this letter, and the timer will work when you see this letter.  Filing a complaint somewhere does not make sense because this email cannot be tracked like my bitcoin address. I do not make any mistakes.  If I find that you have shared this message with someone else, the video will be immediately distributed.

5000g000028cTjVAAU,"#ART collection of ""excise dollar"" of 3 vases","Hello.  Once I thought about how to make the serial numbers of my vases, which cannot be faked. And I came to the non-obvious conclusion, use the dollar. To fake a vase, you need to fake a banknote, and this is counterfeiting and is prosecuted by law. The numbers of the vases are stored with me and you can determine if I have such a number, if so then you have the original.  The first embodiment of this idea was a collection of ""excise dollar"" of 3 vases.

Manuel Miranda, Emily Mortimer, Ben Wishaw and more) with fantastical cartoon sequences just like its 1964 predecessor, this musical is a great pick for those with older children who will understand its slightly more complex themes and not need to be constantly entertained by cutesy characters.

Here are 5 fun ones you'll want to check out.

It stars Charlize Theron as a career politician who decides to run for president, and Seth Rogen as an anti?establishment childhood friend she hires to be her speech writer. Clearly it’s an “opposites attract” type of situation, with an overarching theme about staying true to — and standing up for — yourself. I’ll admit I went into this one a bit cynical, but I ended up really, really enjoying it.

Their escalating tactics to derail each other’s campaign, supported by various shady characters played by Dan Aykroyd, John Lithgow, Dylan McDermott and Jason Sudeikis (on top of countless real?life cameos), make this one a must?see.

5000g000028cU2rAAE,Why Marianne Williamson Belongs Center Stage,"View this email in your browser (https://mailchi.mp/marianne2020/med_art_8_18_19-254437?e=86750cd953) https://www.marianne2020.com/ FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE August 18, 2019 Patricia Ewing Communications Director Press@marianne2020.com (mailto:Press@marianne2020.com) 443-906-1495   Why Marianne Williamson Belongs Center Stage Medium.com (https://medium.com/@cksanders/why-marianne-williamson-belongs-center-stage-286509b6ac22) | C.K. Sanders | Aug. 18, 2019   I first heard of Marianne Williamson in 2003 when she spoke at a popular resort in the Poconos, but it wasn’t until 2012 that her words changed my life.  It was in early 2012 that my mother passed away and my entire life was turned upside down. My mom was a single mother, my best friend, and my business partner — pretty much my whole world for 38 years.  Immediately, I had to move across the country to settle her estate, her debts and liquidate 69 years of belongings, while simultaneously running my small travel business. During a 6-month time frame, the rest of my world quickly imploded; I broke my foot, my cat died, I ended a 4-year relationship, had emergency dental surgery, lost a $50,000 contract due to Federal budget cuts, a former business partner threatened to sue me and the self injection drugs I was taking for my Multiple Sclerosis were physically draining and doubling in price … oh and then there was the catastrophic water leak that necessitated a full condo remodel and mold remediation to put the house on the market. I became a general contractor overnight.  Between the grief and dealing with all of the external events and living in a hotel and eating fast food for 2.5 months, I was in a weakened emotional and physical state. A friend of mine gave me the book “Feel the Fear & Do it Anyway” by Susan Jeffers, and thus my self-help journey began as I voraciously read anything I could find on grief, moving forward and facing fear. Eckhart Tolle, Wayne Dyer, Louise Hay, Michael Singer, Gerald Jampolski were authors with spiritual views and ideas on life I had never considered. Meditation was a life-saver.  Inclusivity appeals to me. I found Marianne Williamson’s books just before she hit “big-time” on Oprah’s Super Soul Sunday. Although she spoke in some Christian terms as it pertains to “A Course in Miracles,” she also talked about Buddha and Mohammed, Alcoholics Anonymous, the Universe and whatever Higher Power you believe in. That was easy, I had none.  I’m not a religious person. In fact, I have a finely tuned “cult-o-meter” when it comes to people or groups trying to get me to drink their “Kool-Aid.” I’m sure between my grandmother forcing me to go to her church’s bible study or various friends who invited me to Jesus Camps cloaked as “The Cool Teen Camping Trips,” I cultivated a healthy skepticism for anything that claims to have a monopoly on the truth. “A Course in Miracles” didn’t claim any dogma or doctrine, so I listened with open ears.  What I learned over the last 8 years of attending Marianne’s lectures and reading her books, is that forgiveness, love, hope, faith, kindness, patience and integrity are the things that free us from the anxiety and the fear we all live with on a daily basis and allow us to work through even the hardest of relationships with others — or with ourselves. “The thinking of the world is 180 degrees” from these qualities and is at the root of all hate, despair, and pain inflicted on others. It’s our egos that are the enemy, not each other. Most of the major religions and spiritual gurus of the world would agree.  One of the most powerful experiences I had was live-streaming her lecture 3 or 4 years ago on race relations where she asked everyone to stand and hold hands and in a mass way, invited the white people in the room to apologize to the brown and black people in the room for the historical injustices perpetrated against them. It was a group meditation and there was not a dry eye in the room, or in my case a dry screen. No one was taking responsibility personally but rather acknowledging the deep unhealed wound, the elephant in the room. Racism is a blight on our society and holding us back and until we heal that, we rinse and repeat the cycle. Marianne was the first one to introduce reparations as a 2020 election issue — it caught on like wildfire and the other candidates starting adopting her language in addressing their positions on it.  Our country was founded on the principle of separation of church and state, and yet “In God We Trust” is printed on every dollar; the abolitionist and suffrage movements arose from the Quakers; the civil rights movement rose up from Martin Luther King, Jr. and the Southern Baptists. At a very basic level, church and state will always intersect because most religions share one common principle and that is “Love Thy Neighbor” and governments are created to serve the needs of you and your neighbors. Governments that “don’t love thy neighbor” commit unfathomable atrocities, jail and starve their people, wage constant war and discriminate on color, sex, and religion — sound familiar?  So that brings me to Election 2020 and Marianne Williamson. The smear campaign against her to thwart her chances to rise in the polls is stunning. They are painting her as anti-science, she is not: painting her as anti-vax, she is not; sound biting tweets and quotes out of the full context to portray her as some hippy-dippy witchy-poo we should dismiss and ignore. Seems her critics are clutching their pearls thinking she’s got a voodoo doll collection, but the truth is the critics are the ones sticking the pins in.  I can say with certainty that no one writing an anti-Marianne Williamson piece has checked her website to see she has actual policy and plans and positions on all the major issues, or even heard her speak for more than a few minutes, or read an entire book or stayed after a lecture to see her cry with those grieving or dance with those celebrating. Most of the pieces cite old and new agey sounding tweets out of context for which she has explained or apologized if they were misunderstood.  I’m sure she’s done well with selling books but money is not her motivation in the slightest. Girlfriend has like 5 outfits total. She’s super frugal and tres fabulous. If greed was her motivator, she wouldn’t have founded and volunteered for charities for decades; if it was, she would turn away people who come to lectures and can’t pay the suggested admission; if it was, she wouldn’t give away countless free books and workshops to those in need and if it was, she wouldn’t throw voting drives, coat drives, toy drives, political events and fundraisers for progressive candidates all over the United States to affect change in Congress. (I was a big Bernie supporter 4 years ago. Did you know Marianne Williamson held campaign events for him even before he announced?).  But society is so jaded that we can’t believe someone would actually want to run for President who doesn’t have a secret agenda, or hasn’t been bought by the NRA or doesn’t have an ego the size of Greenland. Guess what, we have that candidate and it’s Marianne Williamson. No, she’s not just trying to sell books; no she’s not just trying to elevate the conversation; no, she doesn’t accept corporate money and no she’s not trying to get you to join a cult or cure your cancer with crystals. She actually loves America and wants to put it back on track, as we all do. Getting money out of politics has been her constant battle cry for as long as I have known of her. Until we do that, we can never know someone’s true colors and whether they have our best interests at heart.  The DNC has decided there’s only 3 or 4 viable candidates, candidates who do in fact take that corporate money and will always take center stage — and quite literally center stage at the debates. The other candidates are considered a distraction and fluff by both the DNC and the press. Williamson has called this out saying, “there’s an ancient strain of misogyny that labels any woman who doesn’t toe the line with the status quo of her time as crazy or dangerous. Twas always thus. We will not have full empowerment of women until we face that head-on.”  Case in point, if the Pope or even Deepak Chopra were running for election, none of their beliefs like “we all go to heaven” or “meditation changes your brain chemistry” would be questioned. Whether it’s Catholicism or New Age Spirituality, their beliefs have been folded into the mainstream as “faith-based facts,” but yet Williamson gets coined “The Orb Queen” and mocked for even questioning the fiscal role of pharmaceutical and chemical companies in our opioid or environmental crisis, or using meditation i.e prayer and visualization to aid in healing illness?  A single mother herself, she is someone to trust and take seriously. She wants to focus on peace building, education, supporting our children, technology and tackling our environmental crisis. She is the smartest person in the room; philosophy, history, geography, psychology, the list goes on. Not a single candidate could compete with this woman’s breadth of knowledge and determination. And in a morality competition, not a single candidate could hold a candle.  Sure, Williamson’s past is non-linear and unconventional. BFD. She’s not a lemming and is constantly seeking answers and questioning the paradigm. We need more of that in any politician if we are to grow and evolve.  Does it worry me that she has no “political experience?” Not one iota. Look at the kids from Parkland or Moms Demand Action and what they’ve done to mobilize people. Look at the organizers of the Women’s March and the #MeToo movements. Look at all the women who ran in 2018 and got elected. Did AOC have any political experience? Nope. And yet in 1 year, she’s managed to mobilize and inspire hundreds of thousands of young people to fight climate change and support the Green New Deal.  Marianne Williamson will do the same because she is smart enough to know what she doesn’t know. Take all her celebrity fans with a grain of salt. Oprah isn’t going to be in her cabinet. Marianne as President will surround herself with the top scientists, engineers and researchers, financial analysts, diplomats, generals and peacemakers, teachers and doctors to make informed decisions on policies — unlike the current administration.  The other 2020 candidates are like junior varsity volleyball players on stage at this point. This is a bigger 21st century conversation that they just have no experience with. They can talk to me about gun control and immigration policy and the nuances of healthcare policies, etc. until they are blue in the face, but no matter the issue it comes down to how are we treating each other — that and the greed that drives horrible policy making. If you take away the money in politics, we will all benefit and if we all benefit, “love will win.”  Marianne Williamson deserves to take center stage because the only thing to defeat the evil phenomenon currently in the White House is another phenomenon of greater strength and that is one of love. Our country is falling apart, we are at war with each other, we have lost all of our American values and we’re in a ship listing on the high seas of hate. We need someone to turn the ship around. Williamson has done this for decades.  Marianne Williamson for President in 2020 — give just $1 so she makes it onto the stage for the 3rd debate. She deserves to be heard?— just sayin’.  To any trolls who may respond: I love you. It will all be ok.  ###  ============================================================ ** (https://twitter.com/marwilliamson) ** (https://www.facebook.com/williamsonmarianne/) ** (https://www.instagram.com/mariannewilliamson/) ** (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXAMXGAP0YnBxtc8brSSbjg) ** (https://www.marianne2020.com) Copyright © 2019 Marianne Williamson for President, All rights reserved.

5000g000028cNCXAA2,Serving our community will change everything,"Dear Church leader, I am reaching out to you.  You may know me.  My wife, Juanita, and I own the marketplace ministry Kingdom.com.  We are planning a special event to help reach communities through our LifeCenter that is located in the Kingdom building.  If this is successful, we hope to repeat it and, most importantly, this can be done in your community as well.    What we are doing,     We are gathering leaders from ministries that have demonstrated success in serving others.   The leader will host a round table discussion.  People who attend will choose what roundtable to participate in.  The idea is to capture thoughts of people from the community and to stir them to serve.        The response of ministry leaders to support this event has been unbelievably positive.   We are asking each ministry leader to bring 3-5 people to the meeting with them.  We want them to do this to seed the event with participants.      And, of course, we are reaching out to our networks to invite everyone.  That's why I'm reaching out to you.      What we would like you to do.       One...       If you are local to the Mansfield area.   Please promote the event to your congregation.          I am enclosing a link below that goes to a folder with a handout on the round table event.  The table leaders are seasoned in raising people to make disciples, addressing homelessness, drug abuse, prayer, human trafficking, turning dreams to destiny and becoming an externally focused church.    Two..       Please attend and bring your leaders.  We would like you to see what is happening so that for the next event, we can work together to stir more people in our and your area to be more active in serving others in their community.   We already have a list of suggested topic and leaders for the next round.  Perhaps someone in your circle has a ministry that is in the community serving others who would be interested in hosting a table.  If so, let me know.   Details       Date:  Sunday, August 25th      Time:  Dinner is at 5 pm  People can pre-order a gourmet meal, food cost $15 per person or bring their own meal.  Just let me know on the pre-orders!  My sister-in-law prefers a stop at to pick up a Wendy's meal to a gourmet meal!  LOL.      Roundtables:  6 - 8 pm      Where:  Kingdom Building, south end.  719 Lambs Creek RD, Mansfield, PA.  We think this is going to be fun, exciting and, most importantly, help extend ministry throughout our community.  We would like to see round table gatherings happening regularly in every community.   Are you with us on this?  Thanks so much!  Lord Bless!  Johnny Berguson   P.S.  Here is a link to a folder with a Bulletin Insert. HERE  Feel free to print it out.  It is 5.5 x 8.5.  I am also including Print files that you can use to print two on one 8.5 x 11 sheet if you want.     From iPhone:   You can only build one kingdom-build the one that lasts, God's Kingdom. --   <http://www.facebook.com/kingdomchurchtech>",8/16/2019 0:00,,,Junk,,,FALSE

5000g000028cMZkAAM, Savage Is Proud To Support The VTA,"Labor Day Sale starts now...   Good afternoon,  ""The Vapor Technology Association (VTA) and Vapor Stockroom (VSR) filed a lawsuit in federal court against the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA), amongst others, over its unreasonable and arbitrary Pre-Market Tobacco Application (“PMTA”) process and the recently grossly accelerated PMTA filing deadline.  Plaintiffs are taking action to require FDA to publish and complete the long-promised “foundational rules” describing the specific requirements for PMTAs. In addition, Plaintiffs are asking the court to enjoin FDA from enforcing the May 2020 PMTA deadline or taking enforcement action against companies that do not have a PMTA on file until a reasonable period of time after the actual foundational rules are finalized.  With over 3 million vapor products registered with FDA, the arbitrary May 2020 PMTA deadline which FDA is currently enforcing is simply impossible to meet for thousands of small and mid-sized vapor businesses, particularly in the absence of a draft or final PMTA Rule. Any final PMTA Rule must allow sufficient time to conduct the many complex and time-consuming tests and studies currently being required by FDA.""  This is a direct quote taken from the official V.T.A press release regarding their decision and we could not be more proud. We believe the PMTA application is by far the most arduous of the many regulatory requirements governing ENDS products and requires a complex, multi-year, multi-million-dollar process that FDA has still failed to fully articulate despite its repeated promises to do so.  We appreciate all of your support throughout this process and, again, we could not be more proud to stand behind the Vapor Technology Association.  To read more: click here.

5000g000028cLQhAAM,Best Places to Buy in Massachusetts,"Stephanie-- Did you know that Springfield is the best city in Massachusetts to buy a home, investment wise? When looking for a home, figuring out whether to rent or buy can be tricky. There are many factors at play and trying to time the housing market is difficult. However, there are mathematical ways to evaluate each city, so you can make an informed decision. UnitedStatesZipCodes.org<https://www.unitedstateszipcodes.org/> released the 50 best and worst Zip Codes to buy a home in Massachusetts.<https://www.unitedstateszipcodes.org/rankings/zips-in-ma/price_to_rent_ratio/> Based on the latest Census Bureau data for cities with a population of 60,000 or more, the rankings were determined by calculating the price to rent ratio. The price to rent ratio is the median home value divided by the median annual rent and serves as a benchmark for understanding whether it is better to rent or buy in an area. When home prices rise significantly faster than the local rents, the ratio will rise - indicating a possible housing bubble where it may be better to rent. A ratio under 15 indicates that it is likely more affordable to buy, and ratio over 20 are likely better to rent.  Here are the top 5 best places to buy:  1.     01128 (Springfield, MA)<https://www.unitedstateszipcodes.org/01128/> - 10.4  2.     01109 (Springfield, MA)<https://www.unitedstateszipcodes.org/01109/> - 14.2  3.     01151 (Indian Orchard, MA)<https://www.unitedstateszipcodes.org/01151/> - 15.6  4.     01607 (Worcester, MA)<https://www.unitedstateszipcodes.org/01607/> - 17.1  5.     01108 (Springfield, MA)<https://www.unitedstateszipcodes.org/01108/> - 17.1 Here are the top five worst places to buy:  1.     02535 (Chilmark, MA)<https://www.unitedstateszipcodes.org/02535/> - 82.7  2.     01921 (Boxford, MA)<https://www.unitedstateszipcodes.org/01921/> - 77.5  3.     02653 (Orleans, MA)<https://www.unitedstateszipcodes.org/02653/> - 66.4  4.     02633 (Chatham, MA)<https://www.unitedstateszipcodes.org/02633/> - 64.2  5.     01776 (Sudbury, MA)<https://www.unitedstateszipcodes.org/01776/> - 60.6 Please let us know if you have any questions or need more information.

5000g000028cUEdAAM,High level of danger. Your account was under attack.,"Hello!  I am a hacker who has access to your operating system. I also have full access to your account.  I've been watching you for a few months now. The fact is that you were infected with malware through an adult site that you visited.  If you are not familiar with this, I will explain. Trojan Virus gives me full access and control over a computer or other device. This means that I can see everything on your screen, turn on the camera and microphone, but you do not know about it.  I also have access to all your contacts and all your correspondence.  Why your antivirus did not detect malware? Answer: My malware uses the driver, I update its signatures every 4 hours so that your antivirus is silent.  I made a video showing how you satisfy yourself in the left half of the screen, and in the right half you see the video that you watched. With one click of the mouse, I can send this video to all your emails and contacts on social networks. I can also post access to all your e-mail correspondence and messengers that you use.  If you want to prevent this, transfer the amount of $500 to my bitcoin address (if you do not know how to do this, write to Google: ""Buy Bitcoin"").  My bitcoin address (BTC Wallet) is:  3CC5VTWbvW73fWFeS9KR1ZisMMmKXwMMgZ  After receiving the payment, I will delete the video and you will never hear me again. I give you 50 hours (more than 2 days) to pay. I have a notice reading this letter, and the timer will work when you see this letter.  Filing a complaint somewhere does not make sense because this email cannot be tracked like my bitcoin address. I do not make any mistakes.  If I find that you have shared this message with someone else, the video will be immediately distributed.

5000g000028cRkvAAE,"Re: After most shootings, Congress does nothing. This time may be different.","One would think by reading this article that there was no debate that: gun control laws were sure fix to the insane violence committed by Lone Wolf individuals! Never mind the facts! Like not a single gun law suggested would have stopped the El Paso mass murderer from having his guns! Nevermind the fact that the best solution to the criminal with a gun is an honest citizen with a gun! Whether he be in uniform or not! Fortunately our founding fathers did not believe in the rule of the mob! Or what is currently popular, which is why they insulated are inalienable and God-given rights from them.

Today’s edition explores shifting attitudes on gun control, the human toll of climate change, a rare moment of unity in Brazil around pension reform, the efficacy of busing in education, and the thorny nature of emotional support animals. What does recovery look like? In Mozambique’s Gorongosa National Park, it looks like puppies – adorable puppies with mottled coats, giant teddy-bear-like ears, and a ravenous appetite for fresh meat.Gorongosa was once a haven for painted wolves – or African wild dogs, as they are more commonly known. But nearly two decades of civil war wiped out 95% of the park’s wildlife.The havoc and devastation that war brings to human communities is well documented. But the toll that armed conflict takes on wildlife is often overlooked. A multidecade study in Africa found the frequency of conflict to be the most important predictor of wildlife population decline. Fortunately, that same study found that total collapse was infrequent, suggesting that with careful conservation, recovery is possible.Gorongosa offers a glimmer of that possibility.In recent years, the park has slowly been coming back to life, thanks to conservation efforts funded by American philanthropist Gregory Carr. First came the herbivores: elephants, impalas, buffaloes, and more. Carnivore populations have been harder to restore.But one year after the introduction of 14 painted wolves, the park’s ranks are approaching 50. And leopards are starting to gain a foothold, too. “We’ve got cubs everywhere ,” Gorongosa’s carnivore expert Paola Bouley told The New York Times.These early successes are giving conservationists hope – one ferocious litter at a time.     ~                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Noelle Swan                          Deputy Daily Editor                                                     @swannoelle                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ANNOUNCEMENT    Have you set up your password?

After years of partisan gridlock, the conversation on gun control appears to be moving forward, as public support for certain measures grows and the president casts an eye toward suburban votes.                                                                                                                                                                               –  Noelle                                                                                                                                                                                           The 30 Sec.

President Donald Trump, an ally of gun rights advocates, has also voiced support for certain gun measures. And the National Rifle Association, while still powerful, is facing internal challenges.  Polls show overwhelming public support – including among Republicans – for expanded background checks and so-called red flag provisions that would restrict access to firearms when people are deemed dangerous. For Mr. Trump, there’s also a political incentive: He could benefit by signing a measure that would play well in suburban battlegrounds.“The White House is desperate for bipartisan victories,” says former GOP Rep. Carlos Curbelo of Florida. “The president has the strong support of his base – and that’s it. If he gets a mainstream Democratic opponent, that won’t bode well for him. This is an opportunity.”                                                                                                                                By                Linda Feldmann                                                                                              --  To unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to daily+unsubscribe@csps.com.",8/17/2019 0:00,,,Junk,,,FALSE

She combines rich teaching, memorable storytelling, and an in-depth Bible study component to create a resource that shows readers how the story began (the books of Moses), how to live in the story (the poetic books), and how the story will end (the prophets).  THE JESUS WHO SURPRISES TRAILER  over Your Plan  The lead singer, songwriter, and guitarist for award-winning contemporary Christian band Tenth Avenue North shows readers that by seeking God first and focusing on serving Him, we can live daily in His will.""Perhaps God isnt giving me the plan because He wants to be the plan.""This was the aha moment for Mike Donehey after years of wrestling with his obsession to know Gods specific plans for his life. He came to the realization that waiting for certainty from God before making decisions may seem uberspiritual, but it can lead to a life of intense stress, paralyzing fear, and crushing regret—just the opposite of the freedom granted to those living a Christ-filled life.With his signature humor and relentless hunger for God, Mike will show you that discovering the Fathers purpose and plan for our lives is not the game we make it out to be. If youre unsure what to do next, take heart and learn to see God as the plan, not simply the formula to the plan.  Read by Mike Donehey  on the person of the Holy Spirit  The internationally recognized Bible teacher and daughter of Billy Graham shows how the Holy Spirit&nbsp;enriches our daily lives.  &nbsp;Drawing&nbsp;on her rich biblical knowledge as well as her own personal journey, Anne Graham Lotz helps us understand that the Holy Spirit is not a magic genie, a flame of fire, or a vague feeling. He is a Person who prays for us, guides us in our relationships and decisions, comforts us in pain, and stays by our side. In this seminal teaching, she explores seven key aspects of the Holy Spirit that will revolutionize how you understand and relate to this vital third Person in the Trinity. &nbsp; As Anne writes, “One of my deepest, richest joys has been discovering by experience who the Holy Spirit is in every step of my life’s journey. Each name that He has been given—Helper, Comforter, Advocate, Intercessor, Counselor, Strengthener, and Standby—reveals another aspect of His beautiful character and has provoked in me a deep love for the One who is my constant Companion.” &nbsp; Discover how to better love and rely on the person of the Holy Spirit—and embrace how much He loves you.  JESUS IN ME PRE-ORDER OFFER  When you pre-order JESUS IN ME by Anne Graham Lotz, you’ll receive all of these gifts!  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(http://l.e.waterbrookmultnomah.com/rts/go2.aspx?t=1712019&tp=i-H43-Q58-Ppq-1jR1iZ-1o-LTpm-1c-1jR1O7-1lXCF1&x=2E066F1538542B38E0534FD66B0AFA34)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(http://l.e.waterbrookmultnomah.com/rts/go2.aspx?t=1712020&tp=i-H43-Q58-Ppq-1jR1iZ-1o-LTpm-1c-1jR1O7-1lXCF1&x=2E066F1538542B38E0534FD66B0AFA34)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(http://l.e.waterbrookmultnomah.com/rts/go2.aspx?t=1712021&tp=i-H43-Q58-Ppq-1jR1iZ-1o-LTpm-1c-1jR1O7-1lXCF1&x=2E066F1538542B38E0534FD66B0AFA34)  (http://l.e.waterbrookmultnomah.com/rts/go2.aspx?t=1712022&tp=i-H43-Q58-Ppq-1jR1iZ-1o-LTpm-1c-1jR1O7-1lXCF1&x=2E066F1538552B38E0534FD66B0AFA34%7c2E066F1538542B38E0534FD66B0AFA34)Click here to unsubscribe.To opt-in to additional newsletters from WaterBrook &amp; Multnomah, or to sign up for this email with a different email address, go to: (http://l.e.waterbrookmultnomah.com/rts/go2.aspx?t=1712023&tp=i-H43-Q58-Ppq-1jR1iZ-1o-LTpm-1c-1jR1O7-1lXCF1&x=2E066F1538542B38E0534FD66B0AFA34)http://l.e.waterbrookmultnomah.com/rts/go2.aspx?t=1712024&tp=i-H43-Q58-Ppq-1jR1iZ-1o-LTpm-1c-1jR1O7-1lXCF1Copyright © 2019 WaterBrook &amp; Multnomah, imprints of Penguin Random House LLC.

5000g000028cMxDAAU,Bank of America Insights® Study of Operating Charities,"[cid:image001.jpg@01D55444.1B7D3F40]   Henry Osborn The First Church of Christ, Scientist OCRID #  40068   Dear Henry,  We hope that this finds you well.  We’re writing to invite you to join a group of your fellow nonprofit finance and investment professionals in an exciting new research initiative that we will be publishing later this year: The inaugural Bank of America Insights® Study of Operating Charities.  The Study will be directed by William Jarvis, a recognized thought leader in authoritative studies for the nonprofit sector. He and his team, assisted by an Advisory Board of leading professionals at operating charities, have assembled a questionnaire that highlights critical strategic and financial topics facing organizations like yours, including investing, spending, cash management, lending, governance and new developments in cybersecurity.  The Study will be conducted online via Qualtrics, a secure information-gathering platform. As our team prepares for this important study, we are taking steps to ensure that we are reaching the individuals who are most knowledgeable about investment matters for the long-term investment pool.  We believe that you are the appropriate contact at your institution. If that is not the case, we would be grateful if you would reply to this email by August 23, 2019, providing the appropriate contact information for the following fields:  Organization Name: Respondent Name (First and Last): Title: Email Address: Phone Number:  In late August you (or the respondent you name) will receive an email from our research partner, England Associates, via Qualtrics. The email will contain a personalized link to your organization’s survey and will be sent from noreply@qemailserver.com<mailto:noreply@qemailserver.com>. Please be sure to add this email address and Qualtrics.com to your safe senders list in order to ensure that the link is not designated as spam. Should any questions arise while completing the survey, their help desk staff will be available at surveyhelpdesk@englandassociates.com<mailto:surveyhelpdesk@englandassociates.com>.  Should you have additional questions regarding the Study, please reach out to your Bank of America relationship manager or to any of the following Bank of America representatives:  William F.

5000g000028cOYAAA2,Security Alert. Your accounts were hacked by a criminal group.,"Hello!  I am a hacker who has access to your operating system. I also have full access to your account.  I've been watching you for a few months now. The fact is that you were infected with malware through an adult site that you visited.  If you are not familiar with this, I will explain. Trojan Virus gives me full access and control over a computer or other device. This means that I can see everything on your screen, turn on the camera and microphone, but you do not know about it.  I also have access to all your contacts and all your correspondence.  Why your antivirus did not detect malware? Answer: My malware uses the driver, I update its signatures every 4 hours so that your antivirus is silent.  I made a video showing how you satisfy yourself in the left half of the screen, and in the right half you see the video that you watched. With one click of the mouse, I can send this video to all your emails and contacts on social networks. I can also post access to all your e-mail correspondence and messengers that you use.  If you want to prevent this, transfer the amount of $500 to my bitcoin address (if you do not know how to do this, write to Google: ""Buy Bitcoin"").  My bitcoin address (BTC Wallet) is:  35Et1u8ndDk3FkMFP6rPPhomokGs9MUFhi  After receiving the payment, I will delete the video and you will never hear me again. I give you 50 hours (more than 2 days) to pay. I have a notice reading this letter, and the timer will work when you see this letter.  Filing a complaint somewhere does not make sense because this email cannot be tracked like my bitcoin address. I do not make any mistakes.  If I find that you have shared this message with someone else, the video will be immediately distributed.

The amount is valued at $47,745,533.00 United States dollars with a financial institution waiting my instruction for further transfer to a destination account as soon as I have your information indicating interest to receive and invest the fund.I will compensate you with 30% of the total amount and you will also get benefit from the investment.

""You may not know Joe Sestak, though he is running for president of the United States. But wherever you’re from in the world, the Democratic candidate has likely been to , or at least seriously considered, your region of the globe. And he’d love to chat about it.  Sestak—call him Joe though, he insists—has been a congressman, a 3-star admiral in the Navy, a military adviser to former US president Bill Clinton, a college professor, a PhD student in political economy and government, a husband, a father, a wanderer, a global backpacker, and a long walker who crossed 422 miles of Pennsylvania by foot to meet with his constituents . He’s a progressive moderate who wants the US to resume its role as a global leader advancing 'the values-based world order from which we have retreated,' and a military man more inclined to diplomacy than warfare .""  *** Please CONTRIBUTE [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/sestak2020?refcode=em08182019p1] to get this ""intriguing presidential candidate you haven’t seen on the debate stage"" ***  The article goes on to describe my approach to campaigning - and governing:  ""He’s meeting folks and discovering new things, like the popular millennial political podcast Chapo Trap House, where he recently did an interview that made him feel 'cool.' But perhaps what’s coolest about him is that he’ll speak to the right-wing Breitbart News, too, and genuinely wants to share his views on issues , for example, explaining why the US actually needs undocumented immigrants. He’s not squeamish about disagreement, defying his own political party at times , yet he’s not looking for a fight.  'I don’t want to be president if I have to win by outrage ,' he explained. ' I don’t want to just win. I want to govern, and not just by executive order . I understand the outrage people feel right now. But real leadership is taking two different needs and elevating them to one single want.'  *** Please CONTRIBUTE [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/sestak2020?refcode=em08182019p2] to get this ""intriguing presidential candidate you haven’t seen on the debate stage"" ***  Arguably, Sestak knows a thing or two about this topic. He commanded an aircraft carrier battle group conducting combat operations in Afghanistan and Iraq with 30 US and allied ships and more than 15,000 sailors and 100 aircraft. He’s also considered the qualities of a good leader while teaching ethical leadership courses at the historically black college Cheyney University and at Carnegie Mellon.  Sestak says he’s spent much time “ shooting the breeze” with enlisted service members, visiting veterans in prisons and hospitals, going to churches, synagogues, and mosques, and meeting people all over the US whose many different needs can be elevated into a single desire that only he, the little-known candidate, can satisfy.""  *** Please CONTRIBUTE [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/sestak2020?refcode=em08182019p3] to get this ""the intriguing presidential candidate you haven’t seen on the debate stage"" ***  Finally, the article talks about my first day in office:  ""He plans to hold a town hall on the very first day he’s in office if elected president... He also intends to fly to France after his national town hall is over to renew US commitment to the Paris Accord, which Trump has refused to sign, addressing what Sestak considers the number one concern in the world—climate change. While he certainly supports efforts to address the environment at home, he’s also adamant about the fact that global cooperation is the only viable approach to solving this problem because 85% of greenhouse gas emissions are produced outside the US.""

She combines rich teaching, memorable storytelling, and an in-depth Bible study component to create a resource that shows readers how the story began (the books of Moses), how to live in the story (the poetic books), and how the story will end (the prophets).  THE JESUS WHO SURPRISES TRAILER  over Your Plan  The lead singer, songwriter, and guitarist for award-winning contemporary Christian band Tenth Avenue North shows readers that by seeking God first and focusing on serving Him, we can live daily in His will.""Perhaps God isnt giving me the plan because He wants to be the plan.""This was the aha moment for Mike Donehey after years of wrestling with his obsession to know Gods specific plans for his life. He came to the realization that waiting for certainty from God before making decisions may seem uberspiritual, but it can lead to a life of intense stress, paralyzing fear, and crushing regret—just the opposite of the freedom granted to those living a Christ-filled life.With his signature humor and relentless hunger for God, Mike will show you that discovering the Fathers purpose and plan for our lives is not the game we make it out to be. If youre unsure what to do next, take heart and learn to see God as the plan, not simply the formula to the plan.  Read by Mike Donehey  on the person of the Holy Spirit  The internationally recognized Bible teacher and daughter of Billy Graham shows how the Holy Spirit&nbsp;enriches our daily lives.  &nbsp;Drawing&nbsp;on her rich biblical knowledge as well as her own personal journey, Anne Graham Lotz helps us understand that the Holy Spirit is not a magic genie, a flame of fire, or a vague feeling. He is a Person who prays for us, guides us in our relationships and decisions, comforts us in pain, and stays by our side. In this seminal teaching, she explores seven key aspects of the Holy Spirit that will revolutionize how you understand and relate to this vital third Person in the Trinity. &nbsp; As Anne writes, “One of my deepest, richest joys has been discovering by experience who the Holy Spirit is in every step of my life’s journey. Each name that He has been given—Helper, Comforter, Advocate, Intercessor, Counselor, Strengthener, and Standby—reveals another aspect of His beautiful character and has provoked in me a deep love for the One who is my constant Companion.” &nbsp; Discover how to better love and rely on the person of the Holy Spirit—and embrace how much He loves you.  JESUS IN ME PRE-ORDER OFFER  When you pre-order JESUS IN ME by Anne Graham Lotz, you’ll receive all of these gifts!  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(http://l.e.waterbrookmultnomah.com/rts/go2.aspx?t=1712019&tp=i-H43-Q58-Ppq-1jR2Zx-1o-LVVM-1c-1jR1O7-1RI4UH&x=2E066F15826E2B38E0534FD66B0AFA34)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(http://l.e.waterbrookmultnomah.com/rts/go2.aspx?t=1712020&tp=i-H43-Q58-Ppq-1jR2Zx-1o-LVVM-1c-1jR1O7-1RI4UH&x=2E066F15826E2B38E0534FD66B0AFA34)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(http://l.e.waterbrookmultnomah.com/rts/go2.aspx?t=1712021&tp=i-H43-Q58-Ppq-1jR2Zx-1o-LVVM-1c-1jR1O7-1RI4UH&x=2E066F15826E2B38E0534FD66B0AFA34)  (http://l.e.waterbrookmultnomah.com/rts/go2.aspx?t=1712022&tp=i-H43-Q58-Ppq-1jR2Zx-1o-LVVM-1c-1jR1O7-1RI4UH&x=2E066F15826F2B38E0534FD66B0AFA34%7c2E066F15826E2B38E0534FD66B0AFA34)Click here to unsubscribe.To opt-in to additional newsletters from WaterBrook &amp; Multnomah, or to sign up for this email with a different email address, go to: (http://l.e.waterbrookmultnomah.com/rts/go2.aspx?t=1712023&tp=i-H43-Q58-Ppq-1jR2Zx-1o-LVVM-1c-1jR1O7-1RI4UH&x=2E066F15826E2B38E0534FD66B0AFA34)http://l.e.waterbrookmultnomah.com/rts/go2.aspx?t=1712024&tp=i-H43-Q58-Ppq-1jR2Zx-1o-LVVM-1c-1jR1O7-1RI4UHCopyright © 2019 WaterBrook &amp; Multnomah, imprints of Penguin Random House LLC.

5000g000028cSWuAAM,Is Reality Real?,"http://scienceandnonduality.acemlnc.com/lt.php?s=b4c6b86db686cb57d04d16a51583a8d6&i=48A112A7A607   ""You knock at the door of Reality. You shake your thought wings, loosen your shoulders, and open.""  ~ Rumi  Dear ,  Discovering the nature of reality has always been a fundamental pursuit of human beings. Throughout time sages and scientists have dedicated their lives to the question of truth-what is real and how do we know what we know? It turns out, seeing reality-as-it-is is neither as straightforward or intuitive as we might imagine. From Plato's allegory of the cave to the Hindu   **lila,** or divine play, the notion that Reality is somehow in disguise is a universal theme. The reality we take for granted is not what it appears, we are warned. Even Einstein famously said ""  **Reality is merely an illusion, albeit a very persistent one**.""   But why is the truth so hard to see? Is there any objective reality to speak of at all? Even if everything is an illusion, don't we all agree that it is better not to stand in the middle of a busy intersection, or as professor Donald Hoffman puts it, ""  **mess with a lion?**"" In his paradigm-shifting new article Is Reality Real? How Evolution Blinds us to the Truth About the World , he argues that we actually evolved specifically not to see the truth! ""  **Seeing objective reality will make you extinct**,"" he assures. You see, rather than evolving to give us an accurate representation of objective reality, the sense organs actually evolved to help us know only what we need to know to survive. ""  **Evolution ruthlessly selects against truth strategies and for pay-off strategies**,"" he explains, the pay off, of course, being to escape from the proverbial lion.  If knowing reality-as-it-is for a mystic is enlightenment-and for a scientist, Eureka!-for a caveman, knowing what's really going on beneath our sense experience is completely useless. Imagine needing to learn code just to interpret what can otherwise be represented by an icon on your desktop. And so we evolved a friendly user interface for the world. ""  **What we perceive isn't objective reality, but an interface with it**,"" Hoffman writes. The lion we know, in other words, is an icon of a lion.  So, can objective reality be known at all? Certainly, the search for the nature of reality will never end. But we might be a little more humble knowing that we weren't wired to know very much at all, a little more gentle with our path of awakening knowing that illusion is not just a big problem to solve, but a great protectress paving our way, a little more grateful that a mascarade of beauty is guiding us through our precious evolutionary journey, and a little more aware that, as Nisargadatta put it, ""The mind cannot know what is beyond the mind.""

Our freedom is the freedom to be here, not to transcend form, but to be human as well as divine. Click here to watch.  Dorothy Hunt will also be at the upcoming SAND19 US.

Because all things are ultimately interconnected, the challenges we face and the changes underway signal a genuine transformation of the world.   What we need at this time is not a minor repair, but a major transformation of the world that can only start from the inside. Transformation at the level of the individual heart and soul generates the imagination and collective energy needed to change the conditions of the world.

5000g000028cOYjAAM,Williamson supporters are hiding in plain sight,"View this email in your browser (https://mailchi.mp/marianne2020/supporters_8_16_19-253869?e=86750cd953) https://www.marianne2020.com/ FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE August 16, 2019 Patricia Ewing Communications Director Press@marianne2020.com (mailto:Press@marianne2020.com) 443-906-1495   The Press keep asking, who are Marianne Williamson’s supporters?  Williamson supporters are hiding in plain sight The Press keep asking, who are Marianne Williamson’s supporters? Look around. They are your sister, your hairdresser, the guy in the cubby next to you, your friend from church, that PTA parent, etc. This KTVU story by Jana Katsuyama does a great job of showing and telling who they are.  Williamson supporters cross all demographic boundaries and are hard to label in ways that political reporters use to explain things. They are young and old. All colors. All religions. But many are new to political activism and not being called by the pollsters. Here is their story.  Presidential candidate Marianne Williamson visits San Francisco By Jana Katsuyama, KTVU Posted Aug 16, 2019  https://www.ktvu.com/news/presidential-candidate-marianne-williamson-visits-san-francisco https://www.ktvu.com/news/presidential-candidate-marianne-williamson-visits-san-francisco  Some say Williamson caught their attention in the July debate and has inspired them in a way other Democrats have not.  ""I've never been inspired by politics. And I'm inspired to listen to her and to actually start to be an activist and make a difference,"" said Cassie Breeggemann of San Francisco, ""I actually didn't vote in the last election. But I do plan to vote for this one.”  'She's talking about other issues in the way that they aren't. One for sure she talked about tonight. She talked about reparations for American descendants of slavery,"" said Rita Forte of Oakland.  ******  Columnist identifies some of the secrets of Williamson’s appeal  Dahleen Glanton from the Chicago Tribune identifies the key to Marianne Williamson’s appeal in the story below.  Marianne Williamson’s zen is a welcome antidote to Donald Trump’s vitriol By DAHLEEN GLANTON CHICAGO TRIBUNE AUG 01, 2019  During this scary and angry moment in time, a simple wave of her wand seems to cast away our anxiety and replace it with zen. She reminds us that there is a cure for the Trump-induced cancer that is threatening to consume us. There is an antidote, for sure, but to find it, we must delve deeper into ourselves.  She tells us that the only way to combat hate is with love. It sounds kind of hokey in the context of a heated political debate, but maybe there is some truth to it. https://www.chicagotribune.com/columns/dahleen-glanton/ct-dahleen-glanton-democratic-debates-mary-ann-williamson-zen-20190801-mglwweu4yvgyblyjd3uuvklkkq-story.html *****  Marianne Williamson is a new voice to lots of old school politicos  Despite being a popular author with 4 NYT bestsellers under her belt, she has not been a known quantity to the political class in DC and New York and Chris Cillizza was kind enough to give them a Marianne primer this week.

As an educator, she saw that children really loved reading the newspaper but there wasn't any content there for them. So, she started making her own. She compiled interesting factoids, puzzles, drawing challenges, and more, and pitched it to her local paper. Years later, her KidScoop content now appears weekly in over 300 newspapers around the country and in Canada.  ""There are so many benefits to including children in community newspapers,"" Whiting says. ""I wanted children to feel like they were part of the community, because they are.""  Now, Vicki has branched out and is offering content from her KidScoop series in two new ""Learn & Draw"" Books. With the help of illustrator Jeff Schinkel, the two books are A Kid's Guide to Drawing Cartoon Animals (https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/wf/click?upn=G62jSYfZdO-2F12d8lSllQBxexAwTKJVlI7rBzN2jsJWqSDs15xwiMy4WRFOOjnspZQnS8yNCw-2FX7hLkmycfrGAy197XGfjHNVlmIbeC43tjBWpJD1M0-2BYbhHH-2FEiVGVp8SV28W9GZStEJhnS00CAgGVtlSAV1U-2FAgHCw75-2FaNDenvjvnmGvVYm6aE7UHwzCzK_6pchHAirW10eM8b14ZAlkZkRllITHdt0G4CIxpgEX-2FYMT-2FVtvkhkoxOwXdc140hQDKip1v9w6NG6f4yMNdzd3I0JbBoOspHl9BOjIgd0xs1ZoqiRaHbSAU4tmzrjCp-2BK3HPgKXXvAhaRXOaldgUaujscFM8vWTkILMXQzYE36YWZ1tyy-2BIfJM90llHt7ZGeSMt4YrWPV6P2ClJE6rUiB0e5PXYiLbIzYNWCVYXWsbgV7FxPVVxX5K4kpUum15GQFM-2BaK9XC-2BRTb-2F3-2FTlJ-2BCVcbbk5I0CaI-2F64as-2FVVMcnQGiqFtBgjOmvkFqd0xiLHP1edEFdirR-2F8emgbkbVxIGf5ocWLZbst4oK69sX2phohE-3D  and Mind-Boggling Animal Puzzles: A Treasury of Fabulous Facts, Secret Codes, Games, Mazes, and More!

I wasn't just referring to wedding cakes. Organizations that worked with state and federal governments were at risk of losing that opportunity unless they toed the line on social issues. There was little room for freedom of conscience or the tenets of your faith if they clashed with the prevailing administration's views of sexual morality, same-sex marriage, abortion, or gender.  Depending on who held power, it was easy to imagine a situation where Christian organizations would not be permitted to work with the government unless they shed their beliefs. Because that was out of the question, the result was an anti-faith bias in federal contracting.  Fortunately, we now have an administration that protects religious freedom.  President Trump has already issued an executive order regarding respect for religious freedom and conscience. Now, his administration is expanding those protections. The Department of Labor’s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) has issued a new proposed rule clarifying that religious organizations that contract with the federal government are protected. They may make business and employment decisions consistent with their beliefs without fear of sanction.  You can read the proposed rule here (https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2019-17472.pdf?mc_cid=3d6869ff27&mc_eid=[UNIQID]) . Note how it references some of the recent Supreme Court decisions protecting religious freedom and states that the government's role should be, ""to protect religious exercise - and not to impede it."" It also instructs federal agencies to construe the rule broadly, giving the highest level of protection to religious freedom.  In CAAP's press release (https://caapusa.org/2019/08/press-release-caap-praises-trump-administration-for-protecting-religious-freedom/?mc_cid=3d6869ff27&mc_eid=[UNIQID]) on the rule, we praised the Trump administration for keeping the promise to protect freedom of religion. Too many organizations were concerned that the federal government would try to coerce them into abandoning their principles, and the administration took action to fix that. As I said in the release:  ""Finally, people of faith have an assurance that they are not being pushed out of the public square and that their beliefs will be respected. Freedom of religion is the real civil rights battle of our time, and it’s good to see President Trump defend it.""  Of course, we still need to wait for the rule to become final. And we need to recognize that a future president could undo it. That's why it's important to keep working to elect politicians that recognize the importance of religious liberty.  This rule is an important step towards protecting Christianity in the public square, but there's still more work to be done. Fortunately, CAAP is ready to keep fighting for our rights!  For faith, family and freedom, Rev. Bill Owens  P.S. Your prayers and financial support will help us put this country on the right path.

We hope you will share the Infographic Family Yard Fall To-Dos with your readers and followers via social media or in your media outlets.

For more information visit www.savelivinglandscapes.com (http://www.savelivinglandscapes.com) .  The tips are also copied below as text if you would like to feature them.   Kind Regards,  Debbi Mayster  On Behalf of OPEI and TurfMutt  240.988.6243  Family Yard Fall To-Dos  TurfMutt knows that in many areas, fall is a dog-gone good time to spend in your family yard.  It’s also the top-dog time of year to prep our living landscape for another favorite season—spring. Here’s what you need to do now to have a fabulous and TurfMutt-approved family yard this fall and beyond  Remove Leaves: Mulching your leaves rather than raking and bagging is good for your lawn and the environment. As shredded leaves decompose, they feed your lawn, naturally.  Aerate the Family Lawn: Aerating prevents soil from becoming compacted and covered with thatch - a thick layer of roots, stems and debris that blocks water, oxygen and nutrients from reaching the soil.  Mow at the Right Height: Keep cutting your grass until the first hard frost. Find the just-right length for your species, typically between 2-3 inches, to keep your grass healthy when it turns cold.   Water Wisely: If you’re not getting at least an inch of water a week from Mother Nature, you’ll want to keep watering through the fall. Install watering solutions, such as smart controllers on irrigation systems, to help conserve water.  ______________________ If you would rather not receive future communications from The Outdoor Power Equipment Institute, please go to http://FourLeafPublicRelations.pr-optout.com/OptOut.aspx?2240313x36785x72313x1x4584030x24000x6&Email=customerservice%40csmonitor.com.

5000g000028c9vOAAQ,Exciting Breakthroughs For Cluster Headache Sufferers Announced At The Upcoming 14th Annual Clusterbusters Conference,"Dear Stephanie Hanes :  While most people experience headaches at some point in life, nothing compares to the excruciating pain of cluster headaches. These are unbelievably painful, debilitating headaches that are so severe that those inflicted with them are twenty times more likely than the national average to commit suicide as a way to escape the pain.  Clusterbusters is a patient advocacy and educational resource group who are also very dedicated to advancing research that directly affects cluster headache patients. This year, they will hold their 14th Annual Conference in Dallas, Texas. For more details on the event, please read the following press release.  We are available for interviews to discuss breakthroughs in the treatment of these devastating headaches, or to provide information on the conference. Please don't hesitate to contact us. Thank you.  Clusterbusters website address: www.clusterbusters.org   President Bob Wold  bob@clusterbusters.org  630-290-1979 Conference Chair Eileen Brewer  conference@clusterbusters.org  (This press release may be reprinted in part or entirety by any print or broadcast media outlet, or used by any means of social media sharing) FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Exciting Breakthroughs For Cluster Headache Sufferers Announced At The Upcoming 14th Annual Clusterbusters Conference   **Austin, TX, August 15, 2019** ? The Clusterbusters 14th Annual Patient Conference, likely to be the largest gathering of cluster headache patients in history, will be September 19-22 at The Embassy Suites by Hilton, DFW North, Texas. Bringing together patients, their families, doctors and researchers to support and educate all involved, Clusterbusters also advances research, advocates for improved treatments and collaborates on legislative changes needed to end needless suffering and financial inequality.  Clusterbusters is uniting the voices of the families suffering from this debilitating disease. Cluster headaches, nicknamed ""suicide headaches,” have a suicide rate 20 times the national average. The pain is so severe that most people suffering from the disease hide their suffering from family, friends and employers; celebrities and sports figures hide their condition for fear of losing their high-paying jobs.  Clusterbusters is directly involved in supporting exciting new research to be featured during the weekend conference. Presentations will include discussions on the state of the headache community, information about new and upcoming treatments, and information on current and planned research. Inspiration is the theme, highlighted throughout the program, commencing the evening of the 19th with registration and a cocktail hour reception.  For more information and conference registration, please visit: http://ascotmedianews.com/em/lt.php?c=18381&m=20741&nl=1198&s=f56e244f21aead307c5458b70ab88d81&lid=273800&l=-https--clusterbusters.org/event/14th-annual-cluster-headache-patient-conference-september-19-2019/    ###  TIP SHEET:  Speakers include:  •    Dr. Brian McGeeney •    Dr. James Martinez •    Mr. Joseph McKay •    Mr. Mark Massullo •    Dr. Elizabeth Loder •    Ms. Christina Treppendahl •    Ms. Nicole Hemmenway •    Dr. Emmanuelle Schindler •    Mr. Kevin Lenaburg •    Dr. Nate Bennett •    Dr. Mark Burish •    Dr. Shivang Joshi •    Mr. Dennis Pohlenz •    Mr. William Mingus •    Mr. Bob Wold •    Mrs. Eileen Brewer  Many more speakers will be announced soon and will be posted on the event pages.

5000g000028c9w2AAA,NEW STUDY: High Teacher Pay in Massachusetts Leads to Better ACT Scores for Students,"NEW STUDY: High Teacher Pay in Leads to Better ACT Scores for Connecticut Students New Study Confirms Higher Teacher Salaries Correlates to Better ACT Scores NEW STUDY: Lowest Teacher Pay in Nation Impacting Mississippi ACT Scores Students in States With Highest Teacher Salaries Do 17% Better on ACT Hi Stephanie-- A new study https://outreach.topagency.com/campaigns/sr6609lrg2f26/track-url/bp6263scdj83f/4db364d74d867f984f6aec9974b8772559d6d3ff from Brainly— the world's largest peer-to-peer learning community for students, parents and teachers— has found a striking correlation between teacher pay and performance on standardized test scores. The higher the average teacher pay, the better students performed on the ACT, giving them a boost in the race for college acceptance. In the study, Brainly compared the National Education Association's estimated state averages for public school teacher salaries to the state averages for the SAT and ACT.  Overall, Brainly found that the states with the higher average teacher salary tended to see higher average ACT test scores. For instance, higher paying states like Massachusetts where the average teacher salary is $82,042 per year saw an average ACT test score of 25.5, whereas states with lower teacher salaries, such as Mississippi ($45,574 per year) saw average scores seven points lower (18.6).  Infographic attached.  So which states saw the strongest correlation between teacher salaries and test scores? Here’s a snapshot of the findings. * The northeast topped the list. Connecticut topped the list with the fifth highest average teacher salary ($76,455) and the best ACT scores in the country (25.6). Massachusetts came in second ($82,024/25.5); New York came next with the highest teacher pay ($85,889) and the third highest ACT score (24.5).  * States with lower salaries saw lower test scores. For instance, the state with the lowest average teacher salary, Mississippi ($45,574) also had the lowest average ACT score at 18.6. Arizona was the next lowest ACT score at 19.2 and the sixth lowest teacher salary at $49,892. * The higher the salary tier, the better the student outcome. To compare states holistically, they divided the states into three salary tiers: > $50,000; $50,000 - $60,000;  --  To unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to customerservice+unsubscribe@csps.com.",8/15/2019 0:00,,,Junk,,,FALSE

5000g000028cJEyAAM,Pro-life movie UNPLANNED releases Down Under,"View this email in your browser (https://mailchi.mp/carmelcommunications/pro-life-movie-unplanned-releases-down-under-1191925?e=2dabec9bc3)   **  Pro-life movie UNPLANNED releases Down Under ------------------------------------------------------------   ** True story of former Planned Parenthood clinic director Abby Johnson heads to Australia and New Zealand this fall ------------------------------------------------------------   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  For More Information: Kevin Wandra, 404-788-1276 or KWandra@CarmelCommunications.com or Alexis Walkenstein, 561-445-5409 or Walkensteina@gmail.com (mailto:Walkensteina@gmail.com) LOS ANGELES, August 16, 2019 – The controversial pro-life movie UNPLANNED  is making its way around the world. Through a partnership with FanForce, UNPLANNED will be seen in over 100 theaters in Australia and New Zealand starting September 11. UNPLANNED is the true story of former Planned Parenthood clinic director Abby Johnson, which debuted in United States theaters on March 29.  “The last thing the abortion industry wants is truth,” said Bernie Finn, Member of Parliament, Western Region. “UNPLANNED is an uplifting story of one woman’s moment of truth from abortion champion to pro-life warrior. This movie is an invaluable contribution to a debate that is too often blurred by lies. Every Australian should see it.”  To find out where UNPLANNED is showing in Australia and New Zealand or to bring it to a community not listed, visit https://fan-force.com/films/unplanned.  “We continue to be utterly amazed at the international frenzy around Abby’s story,” said Cary Solomon and Chuck Konzelman, co-directors of UNPLANNED. “This proves to us that the world has a hunger to know the truth — to see what Abby saw — and to use this true story to show people everywhere the reality of abortion. No one in the world will be able to say they didn’t know.”  “We are so grateful to the people of Australia who welcomed us with open arms and found a way to bring this powerful story to their country,” said Daryl Lefever, producer of UNPLANNED. “I had the opportunity to visit Australia and it’s incredible to see this story embraced by other countries — we know that the world is suffering under the weight of a permeating pro-death culture and Abby’s story is the antidote.”  UNPLANNED is the dramatic account of a former Planned Parenthood superstar, Abby Johnson. In eight years, she rose from college volunteer, to one of the youngest clinic directors, to Employee of the Year … then she assisted with an abortion. The inspiring film traces Johnson’s journey from staunch abortion advocate to standing side-by-side with the people who prayed for her spiritual transformation and facing the full, head-on attack of one of the most powerful organizations on Earth.

5000g000028cAV2AAM,Review Copy? Action-Packed Novel from NYT Bestselling Author Helps Kids Discover Their Superpowers,"Good morning, Stephanie,  Just in time for your fall book round-ups and to-read lists, I’m thrilled to share an adventure-packed new release from Harper Collins/Tommy Nelson with you: The Hadley Academy for the Improbably Gifted (https://www.amazon.com/Hadley-Academy-Improbably-Gifted-Novel/dp/140021534X) [October 8, 2019] by New York Times bestselling author Conor Grennan. Perfect for middle-grade readers but appealing to anyone who enjoyed The Hunger Games, The Chronicles of Narnia, Divergent and more – this fantasy debut is sure to entertain.  About the book: Growing up isn’t always easy… and most of us aren’t tasked with saving the world. Jack Carlson is dreading a class presentation when he suddenly finds himself transported to the Hadley Academy, a secret institution that tracks teens with unlikely gifts and trains them to protect the world from a secret squad of killers. But Jack isn't the only one who doesn't know what he's doing at Hadley. Despite indications that he is the one prophesied to end the ancient Reaper War, Jack appears to have no extraordinary abilities. When dark, mysterious forces grow, humanity seems to depend on Jack and his new teammates. Can Hadley's rawest recruits push past personal struggles and enormous doubts, develop their dormant powers, and stop the spreading evil?  Grennan’s novel doesn’t only captivate readers with a riveting plot, relatable characters, and humorous dialogue; the diverse cast of characters will appeal to a wide audience, including those who sometimes wonder what their own gifts might be.  I would love to send you one of the first advance copies of The Hadley Academy for the Improbably Gifted, if you’re interested in reviewing. Look forward to hearing your thoughts!  Thanks,  Jennifer Tucker  Smith Publicity  856.489.8654 ext. 303 | jennifer@smithpublicity.com (mailto:jennifer@smithpublicity.com)  CONOR GRENNAN is the author of the New York Times bestselling and #1 international bestselling memoir, Little Princes: One Man's Promise to Bring Home the Lost Children of Nepal. The memoir shares Grennan’s humanitarian work as the founder of Next Generation Nepal (NGN), a nonprofit organization dedicated to reconnecting trafficked children with their families in Nepal. Little Princes has been shortlisted for the Dayton Literary Peace Prize, was the winner of the Goodreads 2011 Best Travel and Outdoors Award, and has been translated into 15 languages. Following publication, Grennan spoke about the book across North America and particularly enjoyed sharing his story with young people at secondary schools and colleges.  For his work with the trafficked children of Nepal, Grennan was recognized by The Huffington Post as a 2011 Game Changer of the Year. In 2014, he was also named a recipient of the Unsung Heroes of Compassion, which was awarded to him by the Dalai Lama. Grennan is the Dean of MBA Students at the NYU Stern School of Business. He currently resides in New Canaan, Connecticut with his wife, Liz, and his two children, Finn and Lucy.  The Hadley Academy for the Improbably Gifted is Grennan’s debut work of fiction, and will be available everywhere books are sold on October 8, 2019.

I've been watching you for a few months now. The fact is that you were infected with malware through an adult site that you visited.  If you are not familiar with this, I will explain. Trojan Virus gives me full access and control over a computer or other device. This means that I can see everything on your screen, turn on the camera and microphone, but you do not know about it.  I also have access to all your contacts and all your correspondence.  Why your antivirus did not detect malware? Answer: My malware uses the driver, I update its signatures every 4 hours so that your antivirus is silent.  I made a video showing how you satisfy yourself in the left half of the screen, and in the right half you see the video that you watched. With one click of the mouse, I can send this video to all your emails and contacts on social networks. I can also post access to all your e-mail correspondence and messengers that you use.  If you want to prevent this, transfer the amount of $500 to my bitcoin address (if you do not know how to do this, write to Google: ""Buy Bitcoin"").  My bitcoin address (BTC Wallet) is:  3FFaepyhie2CJ7Ki9Wbge1mzDUfmSZE2Xn  After receiving the payment, I will delete the video and you will never hear me again. I give you 50 hours (more than 2 days) to pay. I have a notice reading this letter, and the timer will work when you see this letter.  Filing a complaint somewhere does not make sense because this email cannot be tracked like my bitcoin address. I do not make any mistakes.  If I find that you have shared this message with someone else, the video will be immediately distributed.

5000g000028bmqrAAA,I am moving to Scotland!,"Guess what theology nerds?  This is a special announcement.  I have just accepted a position as Postdoctoral Fellow at the **University of Edinburgh ( https://sable.madmimi.com/c/13477?id=2557286.6991.1.b65d7522afe48f1eb7b35a7fd337dbaf )**.

On top of that I will be able to interact and connect with a host of new voices for the podcast, across the pond.  **It really is a dream come true for this theology nerd.**  **Here's where I would absolutely love your help.**  Taking an entry level academic position at a prestigious university will open doors in the long run, so we want to take the venture as a family. The transition over seas will have a pretty significant hit in our monthly income, but being frugal isn't the biggest concern, it is the rather daunting costs of moving over seas. That's why we setup a GoFundMe where you can make a tax-deductible donation to the process.  For over 11 years Homebrewed Christianity has been bringing you online theological resources. With 70k regular listeners and having crossed over 3 million downloads already this year, I know many of you enjoy it almost as much as I do. Your support not only makes the podcast possible, but has enabled me to continue to pursue my dream.  **I am asking for those who are able to help out. Here's two ways you can.**  **Donate to the GoFundMe ( https://sable.madmimi.com/c/13477?id=2557286.6994.1.f5085cc7028aabce6870f11630f435ee )** to help us cover the moving costs. This donation is tax-deductible because of our partnership with ReWilder ( https://sable.madmimi.com/c/13477?id=2557286.6995.1.2614bcd9499459eff5ea75e53ddd9b0a ).  **Join the Homebrewed Community ( https://sable.madmimi.com/c/13477?id=2557286.6996.1.28f9641c0931af3860d1479cf62733aa )** and support the podcast with a monthly donation. You will also get access to a bunch of goodies including a year-long introduction to contemporary theology.  If you're strapped for funds, don't worry about it. Please, keep enjoying the podcast! But if you're able to help out, either one-time via GoFundMe ( https://sable.madmimi.com/c/13477?id=2557286.6997.1.cf2be3a58b2157a60331ece0dd47753b ) or recurring via the Homebrewed Community ( https://sable.madmimi.com/c/13477?id=2557286.6998.1.f849525fbf8a87423785bcf305f84c05 ), it would mean alot to me.

5000g000028blpOAAQ,Re: Expert Avail in Boston- How Students Can Advocate for Themselves ,"Hi Stephanie,  Following up on my previous note. Can we schedule an interview?  Thanks in advance for considering,  Joelle  Back to school might mean back to bullying, and other challenges for students of all ages.  Heather Hansen (https://heatherhansenpresents.com/) , partner at O’Brien and Ryan law firm, anchor at the Law and Crime network, host of The Elegant Warrior podcast and author of The Elegant Warrior: How to Win Life’s Trials Without Losing Yourself [Page Two, April 2019], is available for interviews to teach students how to advocate for themselves. She can address two audiences in particular:  1. Parents of young children who are going to school and need to learn to advocate for themselves with other students and teachers  2.  College students who need to advocate for themselves and stay safe.   Hansen’s advice for young children and parents of young children:  As your children head out for the new school year, they will face new challenges. They will need to learn to advocate for themselves effectively. You can help by teaching them the 4 Ps.   Pause—they don’t have to react right away. Most of the time if they are facing a bully or a “mean” teacher, there’s time to walk away and address it later.   Plan-then they can come home and plan for their advocacy. This is where questions come in. How could they handle the problem? What do they want to say? How do they want to say it?   Practice—playing it out with your children is a great way to make sure they are not only ready, but comfortable. I’d never step into trial without practicing, and your kids shouldn’t face their trials without practice either. (nor should adults!)  Play-when they get into the situation, all they have to do is “press play” on what they’ve prepped and practiced. They can go into the situation confident that they have the tools they need and that the conversation or interaction could even be fun!  This type of preparation also makes children much more likely to respond well when they don’t have time for the 4 Ps!  Hansen’s advice for college students:  As college students head out to their new lives without their parents, they will face new challenges. Some of those are hard, especially in the time of MeToo, frat hazing and social media bullying. Here are some ways they can advocate for themselves in tough situations, using the word DORM as guidance.   D-Discover. First, discover yourself. You can’t advocate for yourself until you know what you want and what you don’t want. Also this is the time to learn your limits with respect to drinking, relationships, and social media.   O-Object. You have to learn to object when you don’t like something. I was petrified the first time I objected in the courtroom. But no one can set your boundaries but you. When you know what you don’t want, it is time to use your voice and set those boundaries. Objections take practice so start small. Don’t be afraid to say “ I don’t like that”  R-Recognize tone and body language College kids need to know that bodies and voices can tell them as much as words do. Tone of voice is especially helpful, as studies show you can tell more about a person’s emotion from their tone of voice than their facial expressions. If they can read tone of voice, they may hear danger before they see it.   M-Move. When you feel uncomfortable, read a weird tone in a voice, don’t like someone’s body language, or don’t like the response to your objection, you can leave. Don’t be afraid to move your body. Sometimes confidence follows.   Are you interested in scheduling an interview or byline? I’m also happy to send a book your way.  More about Hansen is below.  Thanks in advance for your consideration and feedback.  Have a great day,  Joelle  HEATHER HANSEN is a trial lawyer, consultant and professional speaker. She has defended medical malpractice cases for over twenty years, was recently inducted into the American College of Trial Lawyers and is consistently named one of the Top 50 Female Attorneys in the state of Pennsylvania. Heather works as a communication consultant, combining her courtroom experience with her psychology degree and her training as a mediator to help her clients ask better questions, master objections, and use credible persuasion to succeed.

5000g000028cKRZAA2,'Rich Dad Poor Dad' Coauthor Sharon Lechter's 7 Tips to Help Your Kids Learn About Money,"Stephanie,     As kids head back to school, one thing they won't learn in the classroom is how money really works and what they have to do to be successful with it. How can parents help teach their children important money lessons that will help them for the rest of their lives?     Sharon Lechter is one of the world's premier experts for financial literacy and entrepreneurial success. She is author of Think & Grow Rich for Women,' coauthor of the classic book 'Rich Dad Poor Dad,' and her newest release, 'Success <https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1640950737?pf_rd_p=183f5289-9dc0-416f-942 e-e8f213ef368b&pf_rd_r=4MFQ4Z4RRRPQFVECQCFF> & Something Greater,' features never released material from Napoleon Hill.      Sharon's tip to helps kids be more successful with money:     -        Solve a problem or serve a need: At its core, the easiest way to earn money is to solve a problem. All successful businesses, no matter how big or small, solve a problem or serve a need. Help your kids look around the house, the neighborhood and anywhere else they spend time. Where can they lend a hand in exchange for money? It can be anything like mowing lawns, walking dogs, cleaning pools, washing cars and so on. It's not about the amount of money they make, but the key is to start to get them thinking like an entrepreneur from an early age. Additionally, teach them that they don't have to be the one delivering the solution. If they create a babysitting network or dog walking crew, their earning power will increase dramatically because they won't be limited to how much time they can spend themselves. This takes more due diligence and responsibility, but it is a lesson that will serve them for a lifetime.     -        Teach your kids the importance of mindset: Like most things in life, making money comes down to how you think about it. If you believe you are worthy of riches, you have a better chance of acquiring wealth. Similarly, if you grow up not expecting much out of life or to just be getting by, that's more than likely going to be the outcome. Inspire your kids to think big and to reach beyond their wildest dreams. Remember, thoughts become things. As a parent or concerned adult, you have the ability to plant seeds of empowerment and self-reliance. Be mindful of your own beliefs around money and what you may be passing down to your children.     -        Talk to your kids about money language: Many kids these days grow up hearing negative messaging about money. Phrases like ""we can't afford it"" and ""money doesn't grow on trees"" creates scarcity programming. Teach your kids that money is not a scarce resource and they have just as much opportunity to become financially successful as anyone else. Be mindful of your own language when you have money discussion and encourage your kids to start asking the question, ""How can I afford it?"" Or, ""How can I earn money?"" Teach your kids to see money as a positive force and an avenue to create abundance not just in their life, but in the lives of others.       -        Teach them about money early on: Sadly, learning how money really works isn't taught in school. Sure, your kids might learn how to write a check or balance a checkbook, but that's not going to make any child wealthy or successful. Teach your children how money works in the real world, how to grow and invest their money, how to budget their money properly and how to avoid wasteful spending. Keep conversations age appropriate and interesting to keep your child's attention. Many parents avoid the subject because they themselves don't feel comfortable or don't know how to teach about it. Be open with your children about the money lessons you have learned and utilize third-party tools such as the ThirveTime Game <http://www.thrivetimegame.com>  if you don't feel that you have the knowledge you need to help your kids better understand money.     -        Teach them to learn from failure: There's no such thing as a successful person who has never failed. In fact, most successful people fail over and over again. Teach your kids that failure is a part of life and is a key ingredient to becoming successful and wealthy. Failure is an event...not a definition. Let your kids know it's what they do with their failures that count. They need to learn from their mistakes, dust themselves off and get right back on the horse. Share with them your own stories of learning from failure, or find information about other individuals that your kids look up to that will support you in showing them that failure is simply one step closer to success.     -        Teach your kids that they are capable: Life isn't always easy, and as parents, we want to protect our kids from disappointment and hurt. But one of the most important ingredients to a child's self-esteem is their feeling of capability. When they make a mistake, face a challenge or solve a problem, they gain confidence. That's why it's important to not do everything for your kids or make all of their decisions for them. The sooner they learn if they want something bad enough, they have to set a goal, create a plan and accomplish their goals, the better. This is one of the best life lessons you can teach your kids in the pursuit of financial success. Helping to develop a sense of age appropriate self-reliance and responsibility now is going to help them down the road.      -        Celebrate the little wins: One of the biggest obstacles many successful people face is that they don't know when to stop and acknowledge their accomplishments. We live in a world where we can be constantly comparing ourselves to others and to our own idea of success. Teach your kids that becoming successful requires a lot of hard work, but they also have to learn when to take a break, relax and clear their minds, as well as celebrate how far they have come. Success begets more success, but you have to see it and acknowledge it in order for it to build momentum.      Would you be interested in speaking to Sharon? If so, I am happy to set that up.

But first, even legal immigrants are freeloaders.  That’s a perception underscoring Monday’s move by the Trump administration to make it  <https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2019/0813/Why-Trump-administration-tightens-access-to-green-cards> tougher for legal immigrants to become U.S. citizens if they’ve relied on food stamps or Medicaid or housing vouchers. Officials framed the decision as a principled push toward self-reliance.  True compassion isn’t giving someone a fish; it’s teaching them how to fish. In other words, tighter green card rules help people become self-sufficient, administration officials suggest. Of course, tackling the problem of “freeloading” immigrants plays well with voters as we head into the 2020 election.  But that perception is not based on the facts. Let’s take food stamps:  <https://www.csmonitor.com/Photo-Galleries/Infographics/10-Immigration-myths-debunked/(photo)/739915> 93% of all food stamp payments go to native-born U.S. citizens. What about Medicaid? The Associated Press puts that number at 93%.  In fact, if you’re a capitalist, you want legal immigrants. They create new jobs.  <https://hbr.org/2016/10/why-are-immigrants-more-entrepreneurial> Immigrants are almost twice as likely to become entrepreneurs as native-born U.S. citizens, reports Harvard Business Review. Immigrants make up just 13% of the population but account for nearly 28% of America’s entrepreneurs. To become a U.S. citizen, immigrants need to be resourceful, persistent, and determined in overcoming obstacles – the same qualities that make good entrepreneurs.  Just ask South African immigrant Elon Musk (Tesla), Russian immigrant Sergey Brin (Google), or Taiwanese immigrant Jerry Yang (Yahoo).  ~    <https://click.cssubs.com/?qs=f74a1e22ef30b0a0d3a156aec2e7fd3611d5eb9659a51671ce32188aec78615b83f5784c88fd061d7e814356333b1c669b3637b15e5bebc7> Image removed by sender. https://images.csmonitor.com/csm/2017/06/1029905_4_illustration-Dave_Scott_standard.png?alias=square_400x400   David Clark Scott   Audience Engagement Editor    <https://twitter.com/davidclarkscott?cmpid=ema:bundle:20190813&src=email> Image removed by sender. twitter@davidclarkscott        <https://click.cssubs.com/?qs=f74a1e22ef30b0a0ac60d7c497458e4abf6cb91c8d6a93f3374f867220dd94deb305858d0f255282de1b23836f55444699a108b901575b33> Image removed by sender.

Scott Morgan/Reuters        Why Iowa? Our reporter looks at the big role this small, rural state plays in America’s democracy, and in choosing the nation’s next leader.    – David    The 30 Sec. Read    Over the course of 10 days this month, more than a million people will come to the Iowa State Fair to sample pork chops on a stick, ride the Ferris wheel, and gawk at the famous “butter cow.” Many will also encounter various Democratic presidential candidates, making their pitch from a soapbox.  “You have a big burden on your shoulders,” Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar tells the crowd.  For nearly 50 years, Iowa has played an outsize role in the presidential nomination process, with its first-in-the-nation caucuses. And while the state has a mixed track record when it comes to selecting presidents, it plays a pivotal role in winnowing the field. On the Democratic side, seven of the past nine winners in Iowa have gone on to secure their party’s nomination.   Iowa’s voters are known for taking their role seriously. But it is one of the whitest states in the nation, which has led to questions about its influence. Those may only grow this cycle, when with less than a year to go until the national Democratic convention, there are still some two dozen candidates in the running.  “The bigger the field, the more important the caucus is,” says Dennis Goldford, a political scientist at Drake University in Des Moines.

More like Modi: Hindu nationalists nurture the next generation         <https://www.csmonitor.com/Daily/2019/20190813?cmpid=ema:bundle:20190813&src=email#1094063> Image removed by sender.   Ann Hermes/Staff        To understand the crisis in Kashmir, some point to India’s emboldened Hindu nationalists. Our reporter looks at an effort to foster leadership qualities to combat secular intellectualism and corruption.   – David    The 30 Sec. Read    India’s Hindu nationalist movement is taking the next steps in building a new generation of leaders – especially among educated, urban youth.  In creating new higher education programs, it’s drawing upon the popularity of India’s first Hindu nationalist prime minister, Narendra Modi. He surprised almost everyone with a convincing reelection victory in national elections in June. At the same time, his ruling party reinforced its hold on parliament. It’s that kind of political dominance that emboldened Mr. Modi this month to revoke the Indian Constitution’s article granting special autonomous status to majority-Muslim Kashmir.  Mr. Modi has not only boosted the image of the nationalist movement but has also been central to the movement’s growth among a key segment of the population. “You could map the growing interest of educated youngsters, doctors and entrepreneurs and professionals, in entering politics and improving governance to the rise of Narendra Modi,” says Ravindra Sathe, dean of the recently established Indian Institute of Democratic Leadership.

Isolated by Ukraine’s war, this city looks for a peaceful future         <https://www.csmonitor.com/Daily/2019/20190813?cmpid=ema:bundle:20190813&src=email#1093944> Image removed by sender.      Mariupol sits on the edge of a simmering war zone in Ukraine. But our reporter found it is also a place of burgeoning hope, where at least some innovative people are treating the crisis as an opportunity.   – David    The 30 Sec. Read    With the front lines now just about seven miles from the city limits, the ongoing war in eastern Ukraine is seldom far from the subject of any conversation in the port city of Mariupol. But recently, the battleground has become ideological too. More than half of voters in the Ukrainian-controlled Donetsk region cast their ballots for two pro-Russian parties who blame Kiev, not next-door Russia, for their troubles. These divisions are a huge challenge for new President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, whose party came in second in July elections around here.  The challenges facing the city are on full display at Mariupol’s Azov Sea port, which a decade ago shipped more than 15 million tons annually of products to every corner of the world. But the establishment of two separatist republics took much of the port’s hinterland away. The loss of the nearby Russian market amid an ongoing sanctions war between Ukraine and Russia inflicted more damage.  “We all hope that with the new leadership at the top of the country, this war will end,” says Yuri Balan, deputy director of the port. “Peace is the main thing that everyone here in the Donbass wants.”     <https://www.csmonitor.com/Daily/2019/20190813?cmpid=ema:bundle:20190813&src=email#1093944> Image removed by sender.

It’s an age-old fear: There’s not enough good to go around. But scores of Mainers are rejecting a scarcity mindset as their city welcomes hundreds of asylum-seekers.   – David    The 30 Sec. Read    On a recent afternoon, volunteers cooked 600 meals to be served at a local sports arena. Lined with cots instead of bleachers, the Portland Expo Center became an emergency shelter in June with the sudden arrival of Central African asylum-seekers. Several meal prep volunteers are asylum-seekers themselves. They slip in and out of French, Portuguese, and Lingala with the ease of changing aprons. Some have already found temporary housing. Yet day after day, they keep turning up to cook for fellow newcomers.  “My people,” a volunteer named Nathalie calls them. “As they eat and feel fed, I also feel better.”  Portland has gained at least 437 asylum-seekers in less than two months. Their arrival cued another surge: an outpouring of donations and volunteerism. Immigrant community leaders, who once sought fresh starts here themselves, have bridged resource gaps between the newcomers and the public’s generosity.  Maine resident Jeff Diggins has hosted three families in the past. A fiscal conservative from Texas, he acknowledges the complexity of the U.S. immigration system and values that asylum-seekers are in the country legally.  “I don’t think kindness is a limited resource,” says Mr. Diggins.

Bibliotheque de L'Institut de France, Paris        What drives people to continuously learn? Five hundred years after Leonardo da Vinci’s death, we examine the paths he took to endless creativity.   – David    The 30 Sec. Read    Two things consistently fascinated Leonardo da Vinci: the mechanics of flight and the movement of water. His mind was like both, swiftly flowing but occasionally pooling to encompass depths beneath the surface.  At the 500th anniversary of his death, scholars, art lovers, and the public are taking a far-reaching look at his career. Exhibitions in Italy and England, as well as the largest-ever survey of his work, which opens at the Louvre Museum in Paris this fall, are celebrating the master’s achievements not only in art but also in science.   One of those exhibitions, of Leonardo’s drawings, is attracting multitudes to the Queen’s Gallery at Buckingham Palace in London. “Leonardo da Vinci: A Life in Drawing” displays the full range of Leonardo’s elastic mind at work. It conveys a life in process, a man and mind on a continuous learning curve, endlessly observing, studying, thinking, reflecting. The drawings – more than the finished paintings – show him improvising and experimenting, much more than just recording reality.

Daily email share      The Monitor's View     Why the sudden challenge to autocracies?        The 30 Sec. Read    Since 2006, the world has witnessed a decline in political rights and civil liberties. Yet 13 years on, this troubling trend could be in reverse. From Algeria to Slovakia, young people have taken to the streets to push for a range of democratic ideals. The most unexpected protests have been in Russia and in China’s semiautonomous territory of Hong Kong.  In particular, the protests in those two giants of autocracy indicate there is a limit to how much people will tolerate a loss of basic freedoms and the right to self-governance. They also show a strong memory of what happened 30 years ago when Beijing brutally ended pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square and the popular uprisings in Eastern Europe led to the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Soviet empire.  China may yet crush the Hong Kong protests, while in Russia, President Vladimir Putin wields a strong stick. But at least the signal has been sent that democracy’s decline is not inevitable.

As I explain in the book, the dream of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and the civil rights pioneers has been thwarted. Black America has not reached the ""Promised Land."" Instead, we have been led astray by failed policies and opportunistic politicians.  Some people can only see the results, not the causes. Thus, we have seen the development of a kind of racialist politics, where the charge of racism is used as both a weapon against every political opponent and a shield against all criticism. This was the thinking behind Don Lemon's attack on me when I refused to call President Trump a racist.  It's also the kind of thinking that I'm trying to correct in A Dream Derailed (http://adreamderailed.com/?mc_cid=33ed136a8f&mc_eid=[UNIQID]) .  A Dream Derailed (http://adreamderailed.com/?mc_cid=33ed136a8f&mc_eid=[UNIQID])  combines memoir and history with a call to action for all Americans. In it, I suggest that we leave behind the concept of racism, as it holds us back from achieving God's plan.  We're in the final edits of the book now and getting ready for printing. After that, we'll be distributing the book and embarking on a tour to promote A Dream Derailed and the prescriptions in it.  Of course, this is a very exciting time for us. I've had lots of inquiries about where to get the book, whether it will be available in large quantities, on Amazon, and so on.  I promise you that we are doing everything we can to make it as widely available as possible.  Because we are so close to publication, this is your last chance to  become a sponsor (https://secure.anedot.com/coalition-of-african-american-pastors-usa/dream-derailed-sponsors?mc_cid=33ed136a8f&mc_eid=[UNIQID])  of A Dream Derailed. We're very close to our goal for publication and distribution of the book - just a few more sponsors will put us over the top.  Don't miss this chance to become a sponsor - all it takes is $100.  Everyone who gives $100 or more will be given a signed copy of A Dream Derailed and will be listed on our Sponsors page.

You're probably wondering whether we'll be coming to a city near you once we start the Dream Derailed book tour. At the moment, the tour is still in the planning stages, but I will be sending out more details as it gets closer. In the meantime, please help us reach our goal by sponsoring this book (https://secure.anedot.com/coalition-of-african-american-pastors-usa/dream-derailed-sponsors?mc_cid=33ed136a8f&mc_eid=[UNIQID]) .

5000g000028c5MRAAY,Editorial comments and corrections,"The following information was collected:  Name: John  Email: robledoint@yahoo.com  Subscriber: No  Subject: Mercenaries  from Russia make Major push into Africa  Product: csmonitor.com  Message: Mercenaries from Russia make major push into Africa August 13, 2019 by Jerry McCormick Secret Russian forces are training in Africa, which has United States officials very concerned.  Reports reveal that a Russian oligarch has decided to fund mercenaries to train locals so the Russians can get access to local bounty of gold and diamonds in Africa.  Secret, Not Secret The fact that Russia is training locals in warfare tactics is not exactly a secret. The training itself has been sanctioned by the United Nations.  However, what the Russians are really doing there is far from what the U.N. has approved. The Russians training the locals are not normal military, either.  They are actually mercenaries under the employ of Yevgeny Prigozhin, a Russian oligarch with very close ties to Vladimir Putin.  He also happens to be one of the Russians sanctioned for meddling in the 2016 presidential election in the United States.  Stealing Resources The training missions by the Russians appear to be nothing more than a smokescreen for the real purpose.  Several journalists have allegedly been murdered by Russians in Africa for sticking their nose in where it did not belong.  Others found themselves being followed by a car of Russians they believed to have been associated with the mercenary training operation.  The reason for the secrecy seems to be quite clear. Russia wants the natural resources of the area, which are gold and diamonds.  Fearful for their lives, the camera crew documenting the situation left the area the following day, not wanting to end up like its predecessors.  This would seem to be a clear effort by modern Russia to mimic the presence of the old Soviet Union throughout the world, something that is a massive concern for the United States and its allies.",8/14/2019 0:00,,,No Answer,,,FALSE

5000g000028c6m1AAA,Editorial comments and corrections,"The following information was collected:  Name: A Watertown Boring elderly  Email: so.boring.daily.basis@aol.net  Subscriber: No  Subject: Loneliness is major contributing factor of Alzheimer’s disease  Product: Monitor Daily  Message: Loneliness is major contributing factor of Alzheimer’s disease Obesity has become a major public health concern, affecting more than a third of adults in the United States. New research, however, suggests that there are two bigger threats: loneliness and social isolation. A new meta-analyses from Brigham Young University in Provo, UT, reveal that loneliness and social isolation may increase the risk of Alzheimer’s disease by up to 47 percent. While loneliness and social isolation are often used interchangeably, there are notable differences between the two. Social isolation is defined as a lack of contact with other individuals, while loneliness is the feeling that one is emotionally disconnected from others. In essence, a person can be in the presence of others and still feel lonely. According to a survey from the AARP, around 35 percent of adults aged 50 and older can be categorized as lonely. Loneliness and social isolation have both been associated with poor health. One study reported by Medical News Today last year, for example, suggested that loneliness may be linked to Alzheimer's disease, while other research linked social isolation to reduced survival for breast cancer patients. For this latest research, Prof. Holt-Lunstad and team sought to determine how loneliness and social isolation influence the risk of early death. The researchers came to their findings by conducting two meta-analyses of studies that looked at the link between loneliness, social isolation, and mortality. The meta-analysis included more than 3.4 million adults. The data from the first meta-analysis revealed found that loneliness, social isolation, and living alone were all associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease What is more, the team found that the risk of early death associated with loneliness, social isolation, and living alone was equal to or greater than the premature death risk associated with obesity and other major health conditions. ""There is robust evidence that social isolation and loneliness significantly increase risk for premature mortality, and the magnitude of the risk exceeds that of many leading health indicators."" Prof. Holt-Lunstad notes that these results are particularly concerning given that the aging population is increasing. ""Indeed, many nations around the world now suggest we are facing a 'loneliness epidemic,'"" she adds. ""The challenge we face now is what can be done about it.""",8/14/2019 0:00,,,No Answer,,,FALSE

5000g000028c1ZqAAI,FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     DEE-1 IS TO PERFORM AT THE 2019 BLACK MUSIC HONORS,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  DEE-1 IS TO PERFORM AT THE 2019 BLACK MUSIC HONORS  NEW ORLEANS, LA - August 14, 2019 -- New Orleans rapper Dee-1 has been slated to perform at the 2019 Black Music Honors ceremony. He will be joining other celebrated artists, such as Keke Wyatt, Kelly Price, Tony Terry, Leon Timbo, 702, Le’Andria Johnson, MAJOR and many more. The show will be pre-recorded in front of a live audience at Atlanta’s Cobb Energy Performing Arts Center on September 5, 2019.  Dee-1 says, “My new album, God and Girls, has opened so many doors that were previously closed off to me. When real music connects with the fans, the sky is the limit. I’m living proof. Can’t wait to hit the stage at the Black Music Honors!”  Black Music Honors is an annual 2-hour television special established to honor legendary artists who have influenced and made a significant contribution to African American music. The fourth annual Black Music Honors will be hosted by LeToya Luckett and Rickey Smiley. Honored musicians include Freddie Jackson, Tamia, Yolanda Adams, Xscape and Arrested Development. The special will air via syndication from September 14 to October 20, 2019.  God and Girls is Dee-1’s first independent release since leaving RCA.

He is truly the voice of a generation, and has skyrocketed from doing local talent shows to rocking worldwide tours. Growing up in New Orleans, the temptation of the streets was very appealing. But these same streets broke Dee-1’s heart when his best friend got murdered. At that moment, Dee knew that God called him to break the cycle of negativity, so he chose a different route. Dee began rapping in college and became very popular on campus, but upon graduation, he decided to use his charisma and swagger to become a middle school teacher to reach the youth. He soon traded his classroom for a microphone and a stage, and the rest is history. Dee-1 entered the rap game on a mission: To inspire people everywhere to “Be Real, Be Righteous, and Be Relevant.” He has since released some of hip hop’s most powerful albums and has collaborated with platinum artists such as Lupe Fiasco, Macklemore, and Sevyn Streeter. His single, “Sallie Mae Back,” went explosively viral and became known as the “debt-free student loan anthem.” His latest album, ‘Slingshot David,’ is his most exciting project, carrying a theme of finding your Slingshot and using it to defeat your Goliaths—a concept everyone can relate to. From his dreads to his outfits, to his raps, Dee-1 is a colorful personality full of raw energy and pure hype. As he continues to rock big stages and make hit records, all he asks of the people is to stay focused and keep their #MissionVision sharp at all times.   FOLLOW DEE-1 AT: Official Website:https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/wf/click?upn=G62jSYfZdO-2F12d8lSllQB0iMCG4dJswgRzG3VGvqL0Q-3D_9yxjC8pTkqOHKrA-2FxWGl1HYr0tMrnt4N88Ov7XUsknri94MZW6-2FOyqYp3cXTAsQ4qQwITQbKMAB4U8yAxSJewGvKCzjR701zDJ-2F-2BLJ859koP0xcsF0E83iax7BpUo5PSMiA-2BRY5-2BxsTYRvJKJyV5biVIsJl1pODDPwJes-2F-2BJ-2Bx6CECI7RHGMG7fJ-2Bd7QfWbT0jFwy1vjQhgFF8fqH7IHYCtQ5Z683d7KXP-2Bp-2BO9mvbPebuZ5uiIdq0psGhM2oklrFQZ-2FmfQg3YgcSE4Yt3PMlMujXW0TvWB6QEtL1YGieCeS2JOsXkAdO-2FAd6gguqfyIAuCBWaiCIMSjNBaGzF-2FHPASv2lxziW2gG7CTo8ItGhQ-3D Instagram: https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/wf/click?upn=G62jSYfZdO-2F12d8lSllQB9oOLDZSTbZztgIax2cHdIo05m4SQ4lHVpl6am8E5rzo_9yxjC8pTkqOHKrA-2FxWGl1HYr0tMrnt4N88Ov7XUsknri94MZW6-2FOyqYp3cXTAsQ4qQwITQbKMAB4U8yAxSJewGvKCzjR701zDJ-2F-2BLJ859koP0xcsF0E83iax7BpUo5PSMiA-2BRY5-2BxsTYRvJKJyV5biVIsJl1pODDPwJes-2F-2BJ-2Bx6CECI7RHGMG7fJ-2Bd7QfWbTkDpPgW-2FEqNuQpmJhU-2F-2BsF2lTYlViXoQpQfW20JlHC7KgMe6i8z8sIQD06TSUpncBKUsdpj4ZXDENmhvZjwEIF5HjQsKdca16of-2FOenjw-2FEDN77s-2F7Yd6n8cqWVlDw4ZMyitD2sDNmeMtySsUPV4BZn2w9v1Rw-2BB57E8Fra27P24-3D Facebook: https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/wf/click?upn=G62jSYfZdO-2F12d8lSllQB7-2FfNA5ybbus3d-2BYXhcEJq1givQHCViDt-2FDxVqN597oy_9yxjC8pTkqOHKrA-2FxWGl1HYr0tMrnt4N88Ov7XUsknri94MZW6-2FOyqYp3cXTAsQ4qQwITQbKMAB4U8yAxSJewGvKCzjR701zDJ-2F-2BLJ859koP0xcsF0E83iax7BpUo5PSMiA-2BRY5-2BxsTYRvJKJyV5biVIsJl1pODDPwJes-2F-2BJ-2Bx6CECI7RHGMG7fJ-2Bd7QfWbTEM1-2FIBEM3ENoqq-2FbM-2BmIxMHe5wCFxXJttiPnh01ZtENzXGXQJhKHq9DdCCXRZjrhqR-2FLjI-2B-2FM8U17kE5lkSaVIjpDoP76TJJ7KgkHkZWFl05yu8zEmws6c9JRQITS5m6PGUxSfQwGwSMxdZYBAIguEQs-2Fjk-2Bj0apMd3TDY4NZSQ-3D Twitter: https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/wf/click?upn=G62jSYfZdO-2F12d8lSllQB7Ry4YIuq7W5k1ChuXQFwGFwcLcscavXvmh88VC-2BClEh_9yxjC8pTkqOHKrA-2FxWGl1HYr0tMrnt4N88Ov7XUsknri94MZW6-2FOyqYp3cXTAsQ4qQwITQbKMAB4U8yAxSJewGvKCzjR701zDJ-2F-2BLJ859koP0xcsF0E83iax7BpUo5PSMiA-2BRY5-2BxsTYRvJKJyV5biVIsJl1pODDPwJes-2F-2BJ-2Bx6CECI7RHGMG7fJ-2Bd7QfWbTH3EqD91tILTLQ-2BRT5KTzbcke5WUW59vAXORzjSOg5ew-2FoRaFlZMzN8CfXFMr1IaAaJxpq4rsWdCxs3GjBL8exQdkMLORGrQJGuZ2ad-2BPi6J26g8DHxQZrk-2FXBb5Q51aSjkkfqJv0nmmLZtvRVASEZzAExn8AY6r1bQagQZYZpjw-3D Youtube: https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/wf/click?upn=G62jSYfZdO-2F12d8lSllQB8Py45Kv8f-2BYRfyH7N0ZolMhOv3pdRBZj9LH9rx4lbUd_9yxjC8pTkqOHKrA-2FxWGl1HYr0tMrnt4N88Ov7XUsknri94MZW6-2FOyqYp3cXTAsQ4qQwITQbKMAB4U8yAxSJewGvKCzjR701zDJ-2F-2BLJ859koP0xcsF0E83iax7BpUo5PSMiA-2BRY5-2BxsTYRvJKJyV5biVIsJl1pODDPwJes-2F-2BJ-2Bx6CECI7RHGMG7fJ-2Bd7QfWbTUWpTOjAWVYbvIe8qi2eIEXnLO2DwkO5E9LlMx-2FPDc-2Fe01f5-2FEkZxusI32rUQrHz7Hnbzja0xbG1sixtLywZwGm-2FQt-2BHK4vJpsEE7dpLJaWjlJ0wrAq0kRujNLoU9giZtrxxSI46IvOQWFMdRHvBNpjikg-2FBMAzIrL3UK-2B-2Fg0cg4-3D   MEDIA CONTACT: Angelique Phipps Silent West media@silentwest.com 504-654-9592      ______________________  If you would rather not receive future communications from Silent West, please go to https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/wf/click?upn=0jpVdUjq4pKnFqr34rWqKPBnDVGgULAbZVyIGNPuvjg84wSQyuMUoinPmsHWr6C-2BrZvuLInc1PGWAjnHwhIZa-2BNLegss3kUkLBYne1yrJcb7qpSmBjjvZx-2Fxrx4zsfQ8bMuqK97LlEs7ZnngrR3Wec4EOsF8RRY9OEwP4PRBW7U-3D_9yxjC8pTkqOHKrA-2FxWGl1HYr0tMrnt4N88Ov7XUsknri94MZW6-2FOyqYp3cXTAsQ4qQwITQbKMAB4U8yAxSJewGvKCzjR701zDJ-2F-2BLJ859koP0xcsF0E83iax7BpUo5PSMiA-2BRY5-2BxsTYRvJKJyV5biVIsJl1pODDPwJes-2F-2BJ-2Bx6CECI7RHGMG7fJ-2Bd7QfWbT6L6ZFAdi4gw3YITAB7mvpLSrQUnapgh27koGri91lLiDf3g8zYSIkfv-2BC6JgMhXZ-2FtAZZAndSL5mLrhaZ967F-2FD9XFVIRON4FNhAjSUSn4IwQbBxp2xmsjZD70XAAan5kXVP7qZz8xOClMmHwPjhhLBM2YriqWvEFUVHaRhuRvw-3D  Silent West, 5972 Tunbridge Ave, Las Vegas, NV 89139 United States",8/14/2019 0:00,,,No Answer,,,FALSE

As I explain in the book, the dream of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and the civil rights pioneers has been thwarted. Black America has not reached the ""Promised Land."" Instead, we have been led astray by failed policies and opportunistic politicians.  Some people can only see the results, not the causes. Thus, we have seen the development of a kind of racialist politics, where the charge of racism is used as both a weapon against every political opponent and a shield against all criticism. This was the thinking behind Don Lemon's attack on me when I refused to call President Trump a racist.  It's also the kind of thinking that I'm trying to correct in A Dream Derailed (http://adreamderailed.com/?mc_cid=33ed136a8f&mc_eid=[UNIQID]) .  A Dream Derailed (http://adreamderailed.com/?mc_cid=33ed136a8f&mc_eid=[UNIQID])  combines memoir and history with a call to action for all Americans. In it, I suggest that we leave behind the concept of racism, as it holds us back from achieving God's plan.  We're in the final edits of the book now and getting ready for printing. After that, we'll be distributing the book and embarking on a tour to promote A Dream Derailed and the prescriptions in it.  Of course, this is a very exciting time for us. I've had lots of inquiries about where to get the book, whether it will be available in large quantities, on Amazon, and so on.  I promise you that we are doing everything we can to make it as widely available as possible.  Because we are so close to publication, this is your last chance to  become a sponsor (https://secure.anedot.com/coalition-of-african-american-pastors-usa/dream-derailed-sponsors?mc_cid=33ed136a8f&mc_eid=[UNIQID])  of A Dream Derailed. We're very close to our goal for publication and distribution of the book - just a few more sponsors will put us over the top.  Don't miss this chance to become a sponsor - all it takes is $100.  Everyone who gives $100 or more will be given a signed copy of A Dream Derailed and will be listed on our Sponsors page.

You're probably wondering whether we'll be coming to a city near you once we start the Dream Derailed book tour. At the moment, the tour is still in the planning stages, but I will be sending out more details as it gets closer. In the meantime, please help us reach our goal by sponsoring this book (https://secure.anedot.com/coalition-of-african-american-pastors-usa/dream-derailed-sponsors?mc_cid=33ed136a8f&mc_eid=[UNIQID]) .

5000g000028c0C1AAI,Editorial comments and corrections,"The following information was collected:  Name: Bruce Burdick  Email: Brucenburdick@icloud.com  Subscriber: No  Subject: Is global warming the result of modern medicine?  Product: Other  Message: In the year 1600, the average life span was about 30 years. Now most people live into their 80’s as a result of modern medicine. Vaclav Smil in “Harvesting the Biosphere” says 98% of the mass of land mammals is people, their pets and livestock, and 2% of the mass of land mammals is wild animals like elephants and giraffes. In 1600 the earth was in energy balance.   All of the CO2 from burning coal, oil and natural gas was taken up by the green plants on earth. Now humanity emits about 42 million metric tonnes of CO2 per year, and only 21 million metric tonnes is taken up by the green plants on earth.  If disease had kept the human population around 500 million like it was in 1600, there would not be global warming according to me.  Can you ask a climate scientist like James Hansen to answer this question:  “If disease had kept the human population about 500 million like it was in the year 1600, would there be no global warming?”  “Do we need to have people sacrifice their lives like Jesus to save our children from global warming?”  Thank you for considering having people sacrifice their lives to save our children from more than 1.5 degrees C of global warming.",8/14/2019 0:00,,,No Answer,,,FALSE

5000g000028bvlgAAA,Wrongfully convicted was given 2 life sentences,"August 13, 2019 To whom it may concern,First let me say thank you for taking the time to ready my letter and most importantly the letter from my love one. I Edelina Robledo (Lina) am a friend that is helping Addie James Batten get his story out and get him help. He was accused and wrongfully convicted for a crime he did not commit. I don’t have the financial stability to help and his family well they did at the time of his first attorney but we all feel that there was not enough done to help fight his case. There was a lot in the case that was not focus on and I feel that he was not given a fair trail. Please take the time to read over his case and if there is anything you need, more information or know of anyone who can help please feel free to contact me. My number is (915) 999-1492. At the moment he is in the Telford Unit in New Boston, TX. He was given 2 life sentences for a crime he did not commit. Please help!  Here is a bit regarding his case… On June 29, 2017 an outcry statement was made against me by the biological father (Jeffery Winters), that I Addie James Batten allegedly sexually assaulted his daughter (Azaria Winters) by penetration of the mouth and penetration of the vaginal area. The child was taken to Santa Rosa Hospital in San Antonio Texas and a SANE exam was done. Results came back negative. Two additional DNA testing was done on me and the child. Both results came back negative. A trace analysis test was also done and results came back negative. The child testimony/outcry was full of inconsistencies. I  hold the copies of the child-safe interview 1 and 2 on Azaria Winters that shows inconsistencies and what was used in trial was not consistent with the 2 child-safe interviews 1 and 2. Not even close. Only that the child was coached by prosecutors and others to help get guilty verdict I also have a child safe interview from her brother (Isaiah Winters) who the biological father (Jeffery Winters) claims to say Isaiah Winters brought the outcry out. Isaiah Winters did not testify The prosecutor in this case Heather Wright in closing of my trial continuously led the jury to bring the court a guilty verdict, to the point that my attorney requested a mistrial with presiding Judge Honorable Dwight Peschel and was declined I’m a man with many tattoos all over my body and also in my groin area, those tattoos specifically are stars, moon, planets and a dolphin also to have 2 pearl implants which none of this was specifically specified in my trial, only the prosecutor to say to the jury that I had red dots and blue dots on groin area neither of which is in the child safe interview 1 and 2 by Azaria Winters. The state did subpoena photographs of this area only to refer to them as dots. One of the statements from Azaria Winters claimed that I had her brothers name “Isaiah loves James” penis tattooed I me. I do not. Also claimed that I had her name Azaria tattooed on my stomach, in which I do not, as in child safe interview she tells the interviewer “I can read”, She also in interview stated that her mother April Cordova stabbed me and killed me buried me in the backyard and that I went to God. There’s also statement by Azaria Winters that this all happened at our home in the bathroom as I was in the shower. She first claimed that she came in there to ask me to do the dishes because her brother Isaiah Winters wasn’t letting her help and that I placed y penis in her mouth but when her mother drove up with her baby brother Own James Batten I told her to go watch TV. As I pulled my pants up. Then she also came back to say that her mother April was in the bedroom getting dressed as I was in the bathroom of the master bedroom that has a leading door into the bedroom when this happened. She then claimed that I penetrated her vagina with my fingers that they were so big that they hurt and that she was pooping blood as her mother was getting pizza and drove up and I told her to watch tv.This is a small summary of just a few of the inconsistencies in my case and all DNA testing and other test total of 4 to come back negative. I have become a victim of this court so has my family who has spent their life’s savings hiring the defense attorney Alfonso Cabanas with a $20 grand price tag. He himself knows that I am an innocent man and has pleaded to any that I am but today I hear very little from him. As my family lives on Social Security paycheck to pay check. I pray and hope that someone will take interest in my case. I have enclosed a listing of my family and support names addresses and phone numbers Please feel free to get a hold of anyone in discussions regarding my case. Me and my family and support are at a loss for help. This is why I reach out and beg for somebody to hear and see my innocence. Please feel free to share this letter and information and pass it on to anyone that can help prove my innocence.

Today we look at U.S. guns crossing borders, a risky repositioning in the Mideast, new perspective on Guatemala, how Woodstock still reverberates, and what’s up with 5G.   But first, a look at perseverance and adaptation.   Thursday’s report from the U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change did more than lay out the sobering scope of desertification and land degradation and the implications for feeding the world. It also hinted at hope.   “The good news is [that] there’s ample room for mitigation,” Michael Mann, a professor of atmospheric science at Penn State, told CNN. One key piece, he and others say: coaxing more productivity from land. Technological innovation will help. Both consumer and land-use practices will need to shift worldwide. What about local action?   Last fall, the Camp fire burned more than 153,000 acres in Northern California and erased the town of Paradise (most of its population remains displaced). But as Martin Kuz reported in May, some residents emerged with renewed purpose.   And more recently, ecosystem restoration there has become hands-on. In pockets, reports Yes! Magazine, residents are trying permaculture. In its fullest form that’s an approach where native crops and animals are positioned to help one another thrive – think nut trees surrounded by farmed pigs. The self-sustaining, soil-enriching cycle that results can dramatically boost per-acre yields.  “Welcome to the experiment!” Matthew Trumm, founder of the Camp Fire Restoration Project, tells those who have turned up to help. (His own work was inspired by an agronomist’s mid-1990s project in China.)   Already taking root in parts of Paradise: a constructive outlook to pass along.   “Because you’re bringing the next generation [into] thinking about this stuff,” said Mr. Trumm, “you’re healing that next generation.”  ~   |      |      | |   Clayton Collins    Director, editorial innovation      @ClayCollinsCSM     |      |            |       |   |  |  |  |   ANNOUNCEMENT  Have you set up your password?

Illegal border crossing: How U.S. guns wind up in Canada and Mexico    |     |      |       |    Security is a two-way street. The cross-border movement of migrants gets more media attention because of its direction; we asked our reporter to look at reactions to traffic in U.S.-originating guns.    |      |   – Clayton    |       |  The 30 Sec. Read  | |    Guns bought from vendors in the United States and then smuggled illegally abroad are a fact of life across the Americas. But the mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, this month have emboldened foreign stances against lax U.S. gun laws and shifted conversations about what that means for crime and safety north and south of the U.S. border.  Weaker gun regulations in the U.S. have long undermined Canada’s much stricter rules, as guns get trafficked north. The U.S. massacres came the same weekend as 17 shootings in 14 different incidents across Toronto. Border Security Minister Bill Blair said Canada could reduce violence with more money toward stopping guns from the U.S., which he called “the greatest arsenal in the world.”  Some 70% of guns recovered by law enforcement in Mexico and sent to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) between 2011 and 2016 were originally purchased from a licensed U.S. dealer. And of course, more than a third of those killed were Mexican citizens – prompting a withering response from Mexico.  President Andrés Manuel López Obrador urged U.S. leaders to reflect upon the “indiscriminate sale of guns.” Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard went further, threatening to open up a terrorist probe across the border.    | |   By Sara Miller Llana    | |   By Whitney Eulich    | |  Read 6 min.  | |   ( 1429 words )    | |       |       |    2. What Russian deal? Israel and Jordan cast wary eye toward Syria.    |     |       Ammar Awad/Reuters    |       |    The setting of hard lines, with consequences, is as standard in foreign policy as it is in parenting. As one analyst says, citing southern Syria, it’s also “a game of brinkmanship where you can lose control.”    |      |   – Clayton    |       |  The 30 Sec. Read  | |    Russia, the main power broker in Syria, pledged to both Israel and Jordan in 2018 that security arrangements for the south would keep Iranian forces 70 to 80 kilometers from their borders. Israel and Jordan took that pledge to include Iran’s proxies, especially Hezbollah.  But one year later evidence is solidifying that the Lebanese Shiite militant group has become increasingly entrenched in the area. Former Free Syrian Army rebels who have returned to their hometowns in southern Syria after an amnesty agreement with the Assad regime say Hezbollah is effectively “governing” several towns and villages.  Now concern is growing among Israel, Jordan, and regional analysts that an unintended and potentially “devastating” escalation may be around the corner. “Russia promised that the Iranians and militias would be driven out from southern Syria, and Russia did not deliver the goods,” says Ely Karmon, at the International Institute for Counter-Terrorism in Herzliya, Israel.  “We want the U.S. to maintain a presence in Syria, but also to provide diplomacy to give everyone an off-ramp,” says one Arab diplomat, who requested anonymity. “If the U.S. does not create that ramp, we don’t know who can.”    | |    |         Jacob Turcotte/Staff    |     | |   By Taylor Luck    | |  Read 6 min.  | |   ( 1250 words )    | |       |       |    3. Why Guatemala’s next president is already bound by Trump    |     |       Santiago Billy/AP    |       |    Stop migrants, or pay a price. That’s more or less the choice the U.S. administration has given Guatemala. But will it reduce migration – or just change whose problem it is?    |      |   – Clayton    |       |  The 30 Sec. Read  | |    Guatemala’s new president-elect, Alejandro Giammattei, won’t actually enter office for several months. But one day after the election, he’s already inherited a hornet’s nest from his predecessor: an unpopular migration deal with the United States.  Threatened by President Donald Trump with possible tariffs, taxes on remittances, and a travel ban, current President Jimmy Morales agreed to require asylum-seekers traveling through Guatemala to apply for asylum there, effectively cutting off requests from Salvadorans and Hondurans at the U.S. border. The U.S. administration has pressured Mexico to sign a similar agreement.  Critics argue that Guatemala, which is the No. 1 country of origin for people apprehended on the U.S. border this year, is in no position to give safety, or much opportunity. Last year, the country’s asylum system processed only 262 applications.   In the border region of Huehuetenango, a highland state that has one of Guatemala’s highest migration levels, Helen Mauricio Palacios sat on a motorbike outside the polls with her 5-year-old and her groceries, deciding whether it was worthwhile to cast her vote – whether either candidate would bring change.  “If we were a safe country, there would not be so many people migrating from here,” she says. “If people could find the success here that they’re searching for elsewhere, they wouldn’t leave.”    | |    |         Karen Norris/Staff    |     | |   By Maya Averbuch    | |  Read 6 min.  | |   ( 1267 words )    | |       |       |  A deeper look     | |    4. Woodstock at 50: How it shaped a generation    |     |       Melanie Stetson Freeman/Staff    |       |    At a time of upheaval, one music festival defined an era with its counterculture spirit of protest, peace, and equality. Fifty years later, in the midst of similar unrest, its message, and mythology, endure.    |      |   – Clayton    |       |  The 30 Sec. Read  | |    Many Americans would dismiss the gathering as a bacchanalia in the mud – three days of drugs, nudity, subversive music, and psychedelic indulgence. But 50 years ago, Woodstock became a cultural touchstone that defined an era. A number of social protest movements of the 1960s – opposition to the Vietnam War, a push for free love and personal autonomy, a clamor for civil rights and equality – seemed to converge in that field in upstate New York.   Nowadays, the hippie is an endangered species and the idea of music as a counterculture movement doesn’t resonate with a younger generation. Yet in some ways, there are parallels between the idealism of the Woodstock generation and the so-called woke generation. Like their grandparents, the millennials and iGen display a zeal to change the world. Like their forebears, they’re willing to eschew some of the status symbol comforts they grew up with, like cars and homes.   David Crosby, a musician who performed at Woodstock, says the meaning of the festival remains with him. “Woodstock was a glimpse – a momentary glimpse – into what’s possible. Into us being able to live with each other decently and peacefully.”    | |   By Stephen Humphries    | |  Read 15 min.  | |   ( 3370 words )    | |       |       |  The Explainer     | |    5. What is 5G, and how will it affect me?    |     |      |       |    The tech industry touts its next-generation cellphone network as a giant leap in capabilities. But the industry jargon does little to explain it to consumers. We look at what “5G” really means.    |      |   – Clayton    |       |  The 30 Sec. Read  | |    The name 5G stands simply for the fifth generation of cellphone service. In practical terms, that means a superfast and much more reliable service – plus the potential for the rise of an “internet of things” where items like home appliances are increasingly web-connected.   Some analysts worry about drawbacks. Rising prices are one issue. Also, 5G carriers will have to build a much denser network of small transmitters to complement today’s cell towers. Some critics have raised concerns that exposure to so many radio waves could have health effects. The industry says no studies have uncovered any problems. The other big concern is privacy, as more data goes online and is tracked.  The positives: Download speeds will ramp up, so you could download a full movie to your phone in seconds rather than minutes. Wireless companies could begin competing with cable firms to offer home internet and TV service. Your city’s traffic grid would communicate with cars and vice versa to reduce bottlenecks and improve safety. All this won’t happen at once. By 2025, just under half of Americans will have 5G connections, according to Deloitte.    | |   By Laurent Belsie    | |    @lbelsie    | |  Read 3 min.  | |   ( 589 words )    | |       |       |  The Monitor's View     | |    A seed for society’s safety: Gun buybacks    |     |  The 30 Sec. Read  | |    Since July 13, more than 7,000 gun owners in New Zealand have handed over their firearms to police under the country’s first program to buy back guns. “We have to do for the greater good of our society,” said one man as he handed over his AR-15 firearm.  The voluntary nature of gun buybacks gives them a special place in the worldwide debate over gun regulations.  In the United States, buybacks have been very popular since the 1990s, even though most scholars say they do not curb gun violence over time. In the U.S. presidential race, several Democratic contenders now advocate for buybacks after the recent mass shootings in Texas and Ohio.  Yet about 70% of gun owners say they could never imagine themselves not owning some sort of firearm.  Buyback programs help bring gun owners in contact with police and others in a community, fostering a dialogue about the ways to keep everyone safe.  While criminals or potential mass shooters are very unlikely to turn in their guns, their ability to find guns or their willingness to see gun use as normal can be diminished if enough owners decide society would be safer without guns.    | |   By the Monitor's Editorial Board    | |  Read 3 min.  | |   ( 641 words )    | |       |       |  A Christian Science Perspective  ( About this feature )   | |    What has infinity got to do with healing?    |     |    Understanding the concept of infinity plays a key role in the practice of Christian Science, as one man found out when he prayed for a horse in need of healing.

Today we look at U.S. guns crossing borders <https://www.csmonitor.com/Daily/2019/20190812?src=email#1093943> , a risky repositioning in the Mideast <https://www.csmonitor.com/Daily/2019/20190812?src=email#1093888> , new perspective on Guatemala <https://www.csmonitor.com/Daily/2019/20190812?src=email#1093946> , how Woodstock <https://www.csmonitor.com/Daily/2019/20190812?src=email#1093947>  still reverberates, and what’s up with 5G <https://www.csmonitor.com/Daily/2019/20190812?src=email#1093948> .   But first, a look at perseverance and adaptation.   Thursday’s report <https://www.ipcc.ch/report/srccl/>  from the U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change did more than lay out the sobering scope of desertification and land degradation and the implications for feeding the world. It also hinted at hope.   “The good news is [that] there’s ample room for mitigation,” Michael Mann, a professor of atmospheric science at Penn State, told CNN <https://www.cnn.com/videos/world/2019/08/09/amanpour-michael-mann-ipcc-climate-crisis.cnn> . One key piece, he and others say: coaxing more productivity from land. Technological innovation will help <https://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/the-monitors-view/2019/0808/Climate-gloom-and-innovation-bloom> . Both consumer and land-use practices will need to shift worldwide. What about local action?   Last fall, the Camp fire burned more than 153,000 acres in Northern California and erased the town of Paradise (most of its population remains displaced <https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/07/11/paradise-california-population-camp-fire-california-wildfire-fund/1710525001/> ). But as Martin Kuz reported in May <https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Society/2019/0403/After-California-wildfires-what-survivors-say-they-gained-from-loss> , some residents emerged with renewed purpose.   And more recently, ecosystem restoration there has become hands-on. In pockets, reports Yes! Magazine  <https://www.yesmagazine.org/planet/california-wildfire-survivors-recovery-permaculture-20190723> , residents are trying permaculture. In its fullest form that’s an approach where native crops and animals are positioned to help one another thrive – think nut trees surrounded by farmed pigs. The self-sustaining, soil-enriching cycle that results can dramatically boost per-acre yields <https://charleseisenstein.org/essays/permaculture-and-the-myth-of-scarcity/> .  “Welcome to the experiment!” Matthew Trumm, founder of the Camp Fire Restoration Project, tells those who have turned up to help. (His own work was inspired by an agronomist’s mid-1990s project in China.)   Already taking root in parts of Paradise: a constructive outlook to pass along.   “Because you’re bringing the next generation [into] thinking about this stuff,” said Mr. Trumm, “you’re healing that next generation.”  ~    <https://click.cssubs.com/?qs=495d32841c9853df4d4e193a957c92df4320f2cbf7b6fb298cf740c979191f590d2fd5ec959d3c865256c572660f8efabb85774a921c53706f6c785d865d61ca> https://images.csmonitor.com/csm/2017/06/1034591_3_illustration_clay-collins_standard.png?alias=square_400x400   Clayton Collins   Director, editorial innovation    <https://twitter.com/ClayCollinsCSM?cmpid=ema:ddp:20190812&src=email> twitter@ClayCollinsCSM        <https://click.cssubs.com/?qs=495d32841c9853df9c82f58f06063d6e488fed2beacd88fe1bc888982c63ffcb3200a9da7ca75f9ac8d97212e50625d7bd35690bd338ca3dec1f8caa65864657> Daily facebook share <https://click.cssubs.com/?qs=495d32841c9853df1ba6a0ae42326c6affedf5917fc56e910533e9ad8a5e8501d78c784c7410b7f42a2b1d737d3f476fa7ba1d23b9c0f41659066a5103c66dcb> Daily twitter share <mailto:?subject=I+think+you%27ll+like+this+article+from+the+Monitor+Daily&body=Here's%20the%20article%20on%20CSMonitor.com:+%0A%0A+Growing%20back%20better%20after%20an%20epic%20wildfire+%0A%0A+https://www.csmonitor.com/Daily/2019/20190812/Growing-back-better-after-an-epic-wildfire?src=shared+%0A%0A+You%20can%20try%20the%20Monitor%20Daily%20free%20for%20a%20week:%20https://www.csmonitor.com/dailyfreetrial> Daily email share       ANNOUNCEMENT Have you set up your password?

The cross-border movement of migrants gets more media attention because of its direction; we asked our reporter to look at reactions to traffic in U.S.-originating guns.   – Clayton    The 30 Sec. Read    Guns bought from vendors in the United States and then smuggled illegally abroad are a fact of life across the Americas. But the mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, this month have emboldened foreign stances against lax U.S. gun laws and shifted conversations about what that means for crime and safety north and south of the U.S. border.  Weaker gun regulations in the U.S. have long undermined Canada’s much stricter rules, as guns get trafficked north. The U.S. massacres came the same weekend as 17 shootings in 14 different incidents across Toronto. Border Security Minister Bill Blair said Canada could reduce violence with more money toward stopping guns from the U.S., which he called “the greatest arsenal in the world.”  Some 70% of guns recovered by law enforcement in Mexico and sent to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) between 2011 and 2016 were originally purchased from a licensed U.S. dealer. And of course, more than a third of those killed were Mexican citizens – prompting a withering response from Mexico.  President Andrés Manuel López Obrador urged U.S. leaders to reflect upon the “indiscriminate sale of guns.” Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard went further, threatening to open up a terrorist probe across the border.

What Russian deal? Israel and Jordan cast wary eye toward Syria.         <https://www.csmonitor.com/Daily/2019/20190812?cmpid=ema:ddp:20190812&src=email#1093888>    Ammar Awad/Reuters        The setting of hard lines, with consequences, is as standard in foreign policy as it is in parenting. As one analyst says, citing southern Syria, it’s also “a game of brinkmanship where you can lose control.”   – Clayton    The 30 Sec. Read    Russia, the main power broker in Syria, pledged to both Israel and Jordan in 2018 that security arrangements for the south would keep Iranian forces 70 to 80 kilometers from their borders. Israel and Jordan took that pledge to include Iran’s proxies, especially Hezbollah.  But one year later evidence is solidifying that the Lebanese Shiite militant group has become increasingly entrenched in the area. Former Free Syrian Army rebels who have returned to their hometowns in southern Syria after an amnesty agreement with the Assad regime say Hezbollah is effectively “governing” several towns and villages.  Now concern is growing among Israel, Jordan, and regional analysts that an unintended and potentially “devastating” escalation may be around the corner. “Russia promised that the Iranians and militias would be driven out from southern Syria, and Russia did not deliver the goods,” says Ely Karmon, at the International Institute for Counter-Terrorism in Herzliya, Israel.  “We want the U.S. to maintain a presence in Syria, but also to provide diplomacy to give everyone an off-ramp,” says one Arab diplomat, who requested anonymity. “If the U.S. does not create that ramp, we don’t know who can.”     <https://www.csmonitor.com/Daily/2019/20190812?cmpid=ema:ddp:20190812&src=email#1093888>    Jacob Turcotte/Staff    By Taylor Luck     <https://www.csmonitor.com/Daily/2019/20190812?cmpid=ema:ddp:20190812&src=email&id=1093888> Read 6 min.

Why Guatemala’s next president is already bound by Trump         <https://www.csmonitor.com/Daily/2019/20190812?cmpid=ema:ddp:20190812&src=email#1093946>    Santiago Billy/AP        Stop migrants, or pay a price. That’s more or less the choice the U.S. administration has given Guatemala. But will it reduce migration – or just change whose problem it is?   – Clayton    The 30 Sec. Read    Guatemala’s new president-elect, Alejandro Giammattei, won’t actually enter office for several months. But one day after the election, he’s already inherited a hornet’s nest from his predecessor: an unpopular migration deal with the United States.  Threatened by President Donald Trump with possible tariffs, taxes on remittances, and a travel ban, current President Jimmy Morales agreed to require asylum-seekers traveling through Guatemala to apply for asylum there, effectively cutting off requests from Salvadorans and Hondurans at the U.S. border. The U.S. administration has pressured Mexico to sign a similar agreement.  Critics argue that Guatemala, which is the No. 1 country of origin for people apprehended on the U.S. border this year, is in no position to give safety, or much opportunity. Last year, the country’s asylum system processed only 262 applications.   In the border region of Huehuetenango, a highland state that has one of Guatemala’s highest migration levels, Helen Mauricio Palacios sat on a motorbike outside the polls with her 5-year-old and her groceries, deciding whether it was worthwhile to cast her vote – whether either candidate would bring change.  “If we were a safe country, there would not be so many people migrating from here,” she says. “If people could find the success here that they’re searching for elsewhere, they wouldn’t leave.”     <https://www.csmonitor.com/Daily/2019/20190812?cmpid=ema:ddp:20190812&src=email#1093946>    Karen Norris/Staff    By Maya Averbuch     <https://www.csmonitor.com/Daily/2019/20190812?cmpid=ema:ddp:20190812&src=email&id=1093946> Read 6 min.

Woodstock at 50: How it shaped a generation         <https://www.csmonitor.com/Daily/2019/20190812?cmpid=ema:ddp:20190812&src=email#1093947>    Melanie Stetson Freeman/Staff        At a time of upheaval, one music festival defined an era with its counterculture spirit of protest, peace, and equality. Fifty years later, in the midst of similar unrest, its message, and mythology, endure.   – Clayton    The 30 Sec. Read    Many Americans would dismiss the gathering as a bacchanalia in the mud – three days of drugs, nudity, subversive music, and psychedelic indulgence. But 50 years ago, Woodstock became a cultural touchstone that defined an era. A number of social protest movements of the 1960s – opposition to the Vietnam War, a push for free love and personal autonomy, a clamor for civil rights and equality – seemed to converge in that field in upstate New York.   Nowadays, the hippie is an endangered species and the idea of music as a counterculture movement doesn’t resonate with a younger generation. Yet in some ways, there are parallels between the idealism of the Woodstock generation and the so-called woke generation. Like their grandparents, the millennials and iGen display a zeal to change the world. Like their forebears, they’re willing to eschew some of the status symbol comforts they grew up with, like cars and homes.   David Crosby, a musician who performed at Woodstock, says the meaning of the festival remains with him. “Woodstock was a glimpse – a momentary glimpse – into what’s possible. Into us being able to live with each other decently and peacefully.”   By Stephen Humphries     <https://www.csmonitor.com/Daily/2019/20190812?cmpid=ema:ddp:20190812&src=email&id=1093947> Read 15 min.

What is 5G, and how will it affect me?         <https://www.csmonitor.com/Daily/2019/20190812?cmpid=ema:ddp:20190812&src=email#1093948>       The tech industry touts its next-generation cellphone network as a giant leap in capabilities. But the industry jargon does little to explain it to consumers. We look at what “5G” really means.   – Clayton    The 30 Sec. Read    The name 5G stands simply for the fifth generation of cellphone service. In practical terms, that means a superfast and much more reliable service – plus the potential for the rise of an “internet of things” where items like home appliances are increasingly web-connected.   Some analysts worry about drawbacks. Rising prices are one issue. Also, 5G carriers will have to build a much denser network of small transmitters to complement today’s cell towers. Some critics have raised concerns that exposure to so many radio waves could have health effects. The industry says no studies have uncovered any problems. The other big concern is privacy, as more data goes online and is tracked.  The positives: Download speeds will ramp up, so you could download a full movie to your phone in seconds rather than minutes. Wireless companies could begin competing with cable firms to offer home internet and TV service. Your city’s traffic grid would communicate with cars and vice versa to reduce bottlenecks and improve safety. All this won’t happen at once.

Read    Since July 13, more than 7,000 gun owners in New Zealand have handed over their firearms to police under the country’s first program to buy back guns. “We have to do for the greater good of our society,” said one man as he handed over his AR-15 firearm.  The voluntary nature of gun buybacks gives them a special place in the worldwide debate over gun regulations.  In the United States, buybacks have been very popular since the 1990s, even though most scholars say they do not curb gun violence over time. In the U.S. presidential race, several Democratic contenders now advocate for buybacks after the recent mass shootings in Texas and Ohio.  Yet about 70% of gun owners say they could never imagine themselves not owning some sort of firearm.  Buyback programs help bring gun owners in contact with police and others in a community, fostering a dialogue about the ways to keep everyone safe.  While criminals or potential mass shooters are very unlikely to turn in their guns, their ability to find guns or their willingness to see gun use as normal can be diminished if enough owners decide society would be safer without guns.

Understanding the concept of infinity plays a key role in the practice of Christian Science, as one man found out when he prayed for a horse in need of healing. As he turned to God for inspiration, a powerful sense of God’s goodness as infinite came to him. That changed the way he saw the horse, which was soon free of all the ailments.

She became the first gymnast to land a double-double dismount on the beam and a triple double (three twists and two flips) on the floor exercise in competition on her way to her sixth national championship. The last (and only other woman) to be a six-time national champ was Clara Schroth Lomady in 1952.

5000g000028bm2DAAQ,accessing bible lesson [JSH-Online #31122],"Subject * accessing bible lesson Message *  Hello,  I'm a little frustrated because I can't access the Bible lesson even though I'm a paid JSH-Online subscriber. With the old, previous format of the page, with the link on (if I remember correctly) the right hand side, I never had a problem opening it. But now when I try I can't get it.  When I go to JSH-O I see that I am logged in. It says (as always) 'Hello, Pamela' or whatever. I usually either listen to the lesson by phone or I read the hard copy, but the other day I wanted to read it online. So I went down to the bottom of the page where all the links are now and clicked on Bible Lesson. I got to the page but it said I had to sign in, even though I WAS already signed in with JSH. So I entered my email address and password anyway. Then I got an error message (multiple times) saying my password was incorrect. This was a little annoying since I know I typed it correctly each time I tried. Finally I gave up and clicked on forgot password--even though I obviously hadn't--and then I created a new password. But that one didn't work either and I just kept getting an error message till I just gave up. I hope I don't have to create a new log-in for the Bible lesson page now, which would mean two sign-ins, which is so inefficient. Upgraded designs are supposed to make things more simple rather than more difficult, aren't they?  This whole problem seems unfortunate considering how well it worked (i.e., how easy it was to access the lesson) previously, when it was on the right margin (or wherever it was; as I said previously, that's where I think I remember it being anyway).

Read > Guatemala’s new president-elect, Alejandro Giammattei, won’t actually enter office for several months. But one day after the election, he’s already inherited a hornet’s nest from his predecessor: an unpopular migration deal with the United States. >  > Threatened by President Donald Trump with possible tariffs, taxes on remittances, and a travel ban, current President Jimmy Morales agreed to require asylum-seekers traveling through Guatemala to apply for asylum there, effectively cutting off requests from Salvadorans and Hondurans at the U.S. border. The U.S. administration has pressured Mexico to sign a similar agreement. >  > Critics argue that Guatemala, which is the No. 1 country of origin for people apprehended on the U.S. border this year, is in no position to give safety, or much opportunity.

Woodstock at 50: How it shaped a generation >   > Melanie Stetson Freeman/Staff >  > At a time of upheaval, one music festival defined an era with its counterculture spirit of protest, peace, and equality. Fifty years later, in the midst of similar unrest, its message, and mythology, endure. >  > – Clayton > The 30 Sec. Read > Many Americans would dismiss the gathering as a bacchanalia in the mud – three days of drugs, nudity, subversive music, and psychedelic indulgence. But 50 years ago, Woodstock became a cultural touchstone that defined an era. A number of social protest movements of the 1960s – opposition to the Vietnam War, a push for free love and personal autonomy, a clamor for civil rights and equality – seemed to converge in that field in upstate New York.  >  > Nowadays, the hippie is an endangered species and the idea of music as a counterculture movement doesn’t resonate with a younger generation. Yet in some ways, there are parallels between the idealism of the Woodstock generation and the so-called woke generation. Like their grandparents, the millennials and iGen display a zeal to change the world. Like their forebears, they’re willing to eschew some of the status symbol comforts they grew up with, like cars and homes.  >  > David Crosby, a musician who performed at Woodstock, says the meaning of the festival remains with him. “Woodstock was a glimpse – a momentary glimpse – into what’s possible.

In practical terms, that means a superfast and much more reliable service – plus the potential for the rise of an “internet of things” where items like home appliances are increasingly web-connected.  >  > Some analysts worry about drawbacks. Rising prices are one issue. Also, 5G carriers will have to build a much denser network of small transmitters to complement today’s cell towers. Some critics have raised concerns that exposure to so many radio waves could have health effects. The industry says no studies have uncovered any problems. The other big concern is privacy, as more data goes online and is tracked. >  > The positives: Download speeds will ramp up, so you could download a full movie to your phone in seconds rather than minutes. Wireless companies could begin competing with cable firms to offer home internet and TV service. Your city’s traffic grid would communicate with cars and vice versa to reduce bottlenecks and improve safety. All this won’t happen at once.

In the U.S. presidential race, several Democratic contenders now advocate for buybacks after the recent mass shootings in Texas and Ohio. >  > Yet about 70% of gun owners say they could never imagine themselves not owning some sort of firearm. >  > Buyback programs help bring gun owners in contact with police and others in a community, fostering a dialogue about the ways to keep everyone safe. >  > While criminals or potential mass shooters are very unlikely to turn in their guns, their ability to find guns or their willingness to see gun use as normal can be diminished if enough owners decide society would be safer without guns. >  > By the Monitor's Editorial Board > Read 3 min. > ( 641 words ) >       > A CHRISTIAN SCIENCE PERSPECTIVE                            > ( About this feature ) > What has infinity got to do with healing? > Understanding the concept of infinity plays a key role in the practice of Christian Science, as one man found out when he prayed for a horse in need of healing.

As evidenced by included correspondence, this glorious book was apparently offered to Mrs. Ruth Elizabeth Jenks, Director, by Lee Z. Johnson, Archivist, of TMC and Its Activities on May 21, 1985. Mrs. Jenks' son and our branch church member, Tyler Jenks, passed recently and his widow brought the book to us.  We are letting you know that we have it and want to know if you or the MBE Library might have a need for it. Not that we are necessarily trying to find a new home for it, but we felt it was right to correspond with you on the matter before we spent time determining how we can best preserve this treasure should it remain in our hands.

5000g000028c3txAAA,Glamping Cover Story feedback,"Reader’s Write / Feedback  RE: Glamping  August 5, 2019  CS Monitor Weekly Issue  Shame on the Monitor! With the state of the world as it is, to present a cover story on elite butler camping is disgraceful.  When I found this in my mailbox, I almost ripped it in half. There are plenty of needed topics the Monitor could cover on protecting the threatened life-sustaining ecosystems of this planet. Leave Glamping to Outside Magazine.    This administration and corporate interests (fossil fuel, auto, pharmaceutical, and tobacco industries) are undermining widely affirmed Climate Science, air, water and land pollution protections, the Endangered Species Act, to name a few. The Monitor seems timid to directly call out what’s happening to our environment so that it can soothe all readership. Cover the dismantling of the Clean Air Act which has saved millions of American lives and according to government studies saved over $22 Trillion. The Monitor should present bold cover articles that highlight the need for integrated global solutions to these urgent environmental issues.    JENIFER SEAL CRAMER Los Gatos CA     In my lifetime, human population has more than doubled to 7.6 billion; use of food and water has more than tripled; and use of fossil fuels has more than quadrupled. Since 1751, approximately 356 billion metric tonnes of carbon has been released into the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels.  The world’s leading climate scientists have warned we must triple our efforts to avoid near term catastrophic environmental breakdown of our living planet. The average American produces about 130 pounds of trash a month.  In America, 22% of children live below the poverty line. The world is facing the largest humanitarian crisis since WWII with people facing starvation in Yemen, South Sudan, Somalia, and Nigeria. We are empowered to make positive change to create a more life-sustaining, beautiful and just world. ACTION not fear or despair.",8/14/2019 0:00,CSM,Content,,,,FALSE
