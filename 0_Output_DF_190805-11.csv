I often turn to hymn 139 when I am away from my books (The Bible and the Science & Health) and I am looking for inspiration to help turn my thought away from the seeming human challenge and feel God with me. Over the years, I have replaced the word ""walk"" with run, work, drive, ride, swim, and many other actions that are much more freeing with God, but I have never tried ""portaging"" with God.

It was their private activity to sent it to everyone, who wanted it. But since we got the new German bible translation, TMC didn't allow it anymore with the argument, that the bibles publisher gives no permission. But in fact the two men asked the publisher and they got the the permission to publish their reading of the bible part. It seems, all they need, is to get the permission for Science and Health to read.  Could you please help the German field?

Although informative,  they didn't answer the one fundamental question I have about church belief.  Is it still the case that Christian Scientists are required to reject all modern medicine, and rely absolutely on prayer for healing and recovery from illness or injury?  Do you have an estimate for the numbers of adults and children who have lost their lives through lack of medical attention since the foundation of the church?  I look forward to receiving your reply.  Yours faithfully  Aidrean O'Cearra","COP","COP","General Question"

Email Address *   allisonhtd@gmail.com Share your Comments: *  In my humble opinion, we need better wording so we don't give the appearance of Christian Science teaching that mortals are the children of God - especially ones who commit violence. Or, that seeing a criminal as the child of God is somehow a healing view.  Or, that everything is ok because God couldn't have caused a murder.  This subject needs more deep, tender, sensitive consideration.  There is a missed opportunity here for sharing that CS teaches that the mortal experience is the Adam dream, and in reality, God's children are safe, protected, loved and never in danger - because they are spiritual.  Also, how could someone feel peace if a perpetrator of a violent act was ""...free from capture""?  I wouldn't!  I'd be concerned for others in the community.  I would need to know that error will be arrested so that others will be safe.  That struck me as very odd, cold, and uncaring.  I need reassurance that God is just, and in control and that evil cannot escape truth. ""Mortals are the counterfeits of immortals.  They are the children of the wicked one, or the one evil, which declares that man begins in dust or as a material embryo.  In divine Science, God and the real man are inseparable as divine Principle and idea."" (Science and Health, pg 476)  Comment Publication *  Please do not publish my comment.

Our UK Addresses.   I have phoned a number of times and emailed over the last four or so months about this issue.   It still seems unclear if you have got the correct numbers.   Firstly to    104 Palace Gardens Terrace   9 FTQ per month   PObox Blackheath Society   5 per month.   Blackheath still appear to be receiving  6 per month and this was changed three to four months ago but 104 Palace G Terrace received 8 instead of nine.   So in my phone call I asked to be credited for one re POBox address and you are sending a single copy of the Sept one to Palace G Terrace but this is all very time consuming and not helpful re mix up.

"77","5000g000028beUQAAY","Re: Shipping Confirmation jshonline","Dear Friends,  Reading Room : First Church, Hoylake Merseyside, Acct no82552   As you cansee from the email below, our Reading Room has a jshonline subscription for RRuse. Last year when we first purchased it we were told by CSPS that we couldnot pay for it as a rolling subscription monthly on our RR account  as we had a debit not credit card andso we would have to buy the ‘card’ that is mailed to us and activated with a code.But this would be for a max 12 months at a time.  We did this at the stated cost of $360 and thecard for activation arrived with no additional customs costs incurred.   When we cameto renew it this year, using the same method as last year, the UK postalservice (GPO) tried to deliver the card sent by you- as your email below- to myaddress (mailing address for all our RR purchases) when I was away. I returned tofind a  GPO notification that the ‘card’was being held by them as I had to pay a £66 customs fee and an £8 Post Officefee for handling the customs matter. If I did not collect by a certain datethen it would be returned to USA. That date had expired whilst I was away. Theitem had shown up on our monthly Reading Room statement though ($360).   So, I rang CSPS on 6th June 2019. Iexplained all this and was told that you had it on your system as awaitingdelivery due to outstanding customs payment from our end. You agreed that itwould be returned to your warehouse soon as undelivered. In the conversation yourrepresentative agreed that she thought no customs duty should be due for it.  I then queried again (as I had last year) whywe could not use our bank debit card as we do use it each month to pay theReading Room account to you. Your representative was very helpful and said thata debit card can usually be used like a credit card for payments to CSPS if ithas a VISA/Mastercard logo on it and our bank has authorised its use for thatpurpose. Your rep. logged our discussion and suggested that I try andre-subscribe using the church debit card and that we would then be charged asecond time but as a monthly rolling $30.  She agreed that if this worked OK then youwould see this on the account and remove the first requested payment of $360once the activation card had been returned back to your warehouse.   Having checked with our Church Treasurer, Ifound that our Church debit card was VISA and so I tried and used itsuccessfully to open a rolling subscription to jshonline and our RR laptop has loggedinto our RR jshonline account just fine.   Since then we have been paying the monthly $30on our  RR account with you as we expectedto do. However, the $360 lump sum charged for the activation card is stillappearing on our monthly statement. Please confirm that this should now beremoved from the statement as we never received the activation card and are nowpaying for the subscription on the monthly basis.

It was a gigantic cockup as most of those events were.  And the generation that grew up in the 1960s has a lot to answer for.  Some examples:  The Clintons (both Bill and Hillary) and the Obamas (both Barack and Michelle) with their disastrous presidency.   The generation that got degrees in the 1960s went on to take over the faculties of our universities and proceeded to ruin said universities.  It might take two or three generations for the surviving ones, after the inevitable bankruptcies of many, to revive real education at those universities.  So far, my children seem to have avoided the moral bankruptcy the 1960s, for which I'd like to take credit but won't as my children (5) were and are a very independent bunch of individuals.  As for my grandchildren, most are too young now to know how they will turn out but since my children seemed to have avoided it maybe they'll communicate that to their children. As for myself, having been graduated from high school in 1957, I was too busy working seven days a week and going to college four nights a week to participate in what I regard as the colossal stupidities of most of my generation.  So, please.  Don't tell me about the changes that generation foisted up our nation.  We are still paying the price.  I still hope that one of these days the nation as a whole will wake up and return to the moral base our founding fathers endowed us with. If you desire any more feedback, you have my email.

At that time, arms consisted of flint lock rifles and pistols, canons, swords and bayonets. The flint lock guns and rifles were single shot and would take a minute or two to reload. We had thirteen states that were sparsely populated with a lot of distance between neighbors. Our army consisted of local militias that were not very well trained. Police forces were rare and not sophisticated. Residents might have to defend themselves from robbery or savages.  Today, none of that exists. We have sophisticated armed forces and police departments. We don't have to worry about savages. We might want a hand gun for defense against a criminal. We might want a rifle for hunting. Do we need an assault rifle for any of these purposes? Do you think the writers of the 2nd amendment would include assault rifles if they were writing it today?  Assault rifles are weapons of war and are designed for one purpose only and that is to kill people, lots of people very quickly. Assault rifles should not be legal for general public but only for our military.","CSM","CSM.com","Editorial"

"97","5000g000028bAs4AAE","talk to ""smart people"" about God","Dear Editors,   After reading “How can I talk to ‘smart people’ about God?” in the August issue of the Journal, I wanted to add my own answer to the question.  I hope you don’t mind!   Q: How can I talk to my friends about God and Christian Science when they say intelligent people are too smart to have faith or believe in a higher power?   A:  With respect, humilty, and fearlessness!  Why fearlessness?  Because the question implies that atheism has a reason to feel smug, while thought accustomed to turning to God is on the defensive.  Right from the start, we don’t want to buy into that notion.  We do have something precious to share, something that humanity is deeply yearning for.   Actually, the fact is quite the opposite of that premise.  Intelligent people are too smart to be ignorant of the source of all being, and the true nature of reality.  Stated in human terms, they are too smart to believe that they already have everything all figured out, and whatever does not fit their rigid conception of reality is worthy of scorn.  That is decidedly not a scientific frame of mind!   Since evolution regards random occurences as the driver of the development of all forms of life, I like to think of atheism as faith in chance, whereas acknowledging God as Creator is faith in intelligence.  Most intelligent people would not choose to place their trust in chance over intelligence.  We can marvel at what people are willing to believe chance is capable of creating!   One of the most arresting statements I know of — and a perfect pivot for this kind of conversation — is from Science and Health, p. 313:  “Jesus of Nazareth was the most scientific man that ever trod the globe. He plunged beneath the material surface of things, and found the spiritual cause.”   And how do you know that all the works attributed to Jesus are not simple legend or pure fabrication?  Why, from your own life, and the experiences of your family members and fellow church members, of course!  You know because you have found you can turn to this Science in every situation for consistent healing results.  Sharing some of those healings with your friends, as well as the fact that you trust your health to this scientific practice, clearly shows that for you, religion is not dogma and ritual — which is generally how non-religious people view religion.   Here, the laws of aerodynamics provide a useful example.  Before these laws were understood, maybe the idea of a hot air balloon, or a light-weight glider, would be acceptable.  But a jumbo jet?  A flying machine weighing hundreds of tons, capable of carrying hundreds of people and delivering them safely to distant destinations?  What intelligent person could possibly believe such a preposterous notion as that?  Yet, an idea that would have been ridiculed and scorned has now become universally accepted, simply because the laws behind it have been understood and demonstrated.  And we feel we can trust our lives safely to an all-good God, because we are learning to understand and demonstrate His laws.    ?Sincerely,  Robin Smith  303-815-2248 3076 S Grape Way Denver, CO 80222","JSH","Journal","Feedback - Positive"

"100","5000g000028bKhTAAU","Re: Why El Paso is determined not to roll up the welcome mat","Listening for the voice of Love, not hate I believe that we as a people are love.  That love is our deepest truth and truest part of our being.  I also believe that God's gift of free will is the source of our greatest triumphs and deepest despair.  It means to me that our current troubles will end when we have had enough of fear and hate.  When we realize that we have gone too far down a dark road and must return to our true self.  It our job to show those around us what love is.  Love is not responding to hate with more hate, yet neither is it sitting passively by waiting for a decree from the Almighty.  It is working to change the situations that are fueling the hate, it is showing the world that love is not passive, love is involved in making the world better.  In my case it is working with my Buddhist Temple to feed the homeless here in San Diego.  It is also working with people to show that there are ways to address gun violence.  In short, it is getting involved to make my part of the world a kinder and gentler place.

"121","5000g000028bDjWAAU","Protecting Our Children  [JSH-Online #31103]","Subject * Protecting Our Children Message *  August7,2019 Dear Christian Science Publishing Society, The continued killings of children and adults by young people has saddened our entire county and the world. As a longtime Christian Scientist, my heart goes out to the innocent. In prayer I have asked God what can I do? What do I need to know? I am only 1 person. Divine Love’s answer came a few days later. He told me that the children of this generation have not be been taught of the Lord. Very few if any have been taught the Ten Commandments, the beatitudes, the Golden Rule or how to pray. Gun laws can only do so much to protect children and adults. But knowledge of a Loving Creator who is with us all the time known as Immanuel will. But how do we get the word out there into the public? An idea came to me which I would love to share with you… The Christian Science Publishing Society could print a new poster with the afore mentioned ideas; The 10 commandments, The Beatitudes, The Golden Rule and the Lord’s Prayer. Maybe it could include The Children’s Prayer by Mary Baker Eddy. This idea could also be shared in pamphlet form at a reasonable price so that members could buy several copies to share with children and their parents. I would not consider this proselytizing.  The members could share it with people they know or with people Divine Mind has told them to share it with. It’s offering a cup of cold water in Christ’s name. It’s bringing the Truth to God’s little ones. It’s the best protection against evil, because it’s the Law of God-Good. For God is the preserver of man (and children). The poster and pamphlet could be available for sale through the Reading Rooms or on line. Thank you for considering this idea. We can all make a difference in this world and the future.

We also pull back the curtain<https://www.csmonitor.com/Daily/2019/20190807?src=email#1093692> on the U.S.-China economic battle, look at how President Donald Trump’s approach to foreign policy is changing the Middle East<https://www.csmonitor.com/Daily/2019/20190807?src=email#1093695>, examine why independent bookstores endure<https://www.csmonitor.com/Daily/2019/20190807?src=email#1093770>, and tell the story of one family’s amazing dedication<https://www.csmonitor.com/Daily/2019/20190807?src=email#1093696> to save a rare horse breed.  But first a look at why the world should be watching Hong Kong.  These days, it would seem, authoritarianism is on the march. From Russia to the Philippines to Saudi Arabia, strongmen seem to be calling the shots. Elsewhere, strains of populism have some worried that democratic norms are under threat or already in tatters.  But in Hong Kong, protesters have put the strongest of strongmen – Chinese President Xi Jinping – in a bind. The demonstrators are increasingly worried that the Hong Kong they love is vanishing. The rights and liberties that have made the city a unique and flourishing hub of culture and global trade seem to be hanging in the balance. So The Wall Street Journal notes<https://www.wsj.com/articles/prepared-to-die-hong-kong-protesters-embrace-hard-core-tactics-challenge-beijing-11565038264> that protesters are becoming more desperate and radical in their determination to fight for their way of life.  It is a reminder that freedoms, once spread, are hard to take away. To be sure, mainland China holds the upper hand. But Hong Kong – and Taiwan – show that freedom and justice put down tenacious roots. For decades after World War II, the world took flawed but unprecedented steps to spread and protect freedoms across the globe. Hong Kong shows that such seeds can be transformative.  ~ [https://images.csmonitor.com/csm/2017/06/1025853_4_Mark-Sappenfield-drawing_standard.png?alias=square_400x400] <https://click.cssubs.com/?qs=220a9d3cc0d89f943b9d122dd246bf5131125e16b869a118e6c2a9d6cc76ef6ffee88dd6620a644b9c177414cb331d21c6e50364eb146bf3>  Mark Sappenfield  Editor  [twitter] @sappenfieldm <https://twitter.com/sappenfieldm?cmpid=ema:bundle:20190807&src=email>  [Daily facebook share] <https://click.cssubs.com/?qs=220a9d3cc0d89f941e8dc8b609dd5ff3d23bac040ebf1c13d5895baf428883dbe9419a3245f722a7003de39a1a8073016fa9e50c77fd7b68> [Daily twitter share]  <https://click.cssubs.com/?qs=220a9d3cc0d89f9491af6a962f666028b8c2bf8a2d38f4344b0a291c0190f8277b3f3c3df0d2dc58703a8bf2022ec94ced8f1d72a7839718> [Daily email share]  <mailto:?subject=I+think+you%27ll+like+this+article+from+the+Monitor+Daily&body=Here's%20the%20article%20on%20CSMonitor.com:+%0A%0A+Hong%20Kong%20protests%20show%20how%20deeply%20roots%20of%20freedom%20have%20grown+%0A%0A+https://www.csmonitor.com/Daily/2019/20190807/Hong-Kong-protests-show-how-deeply-roots-of-freedom-have-grown?src=shared+%0A%0A+You%20can%20try%20the%20Monitor%20Daily%20free%20for%20a%20week:%20https://www.csmonitor.com/dailyfreetrial> 1.

Its embrace of all isn’t going anywhere, they say, despite a terrorist attack aimed at its diversity.  – Mark  The 30 Sec. Read  As the sun set over El Paso, Texas, dozens of people gather outside the Immaculate Baptist Church for a vigil for the 22 people who died in an attack at a Walmart. Pastor J.C. Rico leads prayers in both English and Spanish.  “I refuse to let that change the way we live, change the way we are,” says Rosie Rico, the pastor’s wife.  The alleged gunman had no ties to this 400-year-old city on the banks of the Rio Grande. He drove more than 600 miles from a Dallas suburb to commit the attack, which law enforcement are treating as domestic terrorism. El Paso has been, for years now, statistically one of the safest cities in the country – but now some residents are questioning whether they are safe from the rest of America.  “It’s like we’re the antithesis of how a lot of people in the heartland, where I grew up, view us,” says Bill Clark, co-owner of the bookstore Literarity. “It’s probably the most welcoming city one could want to live in.”  Daniel Aguilar, who attended the vigil, says, “It sounds like [the gunman] was not getting love. He would have got love from us. We would have given him love.”  By Henry Gass  [twitter]@henrygass<https://twitter.com/henrygass?cmpid=ema:bundle:20190807&src=email>  Read 7 min.<https://www.csmonitor.com/Daily/2019/20190807?cmpid=ema:bundle:20190807&src=email&id=1093691>  ( 1648 words )  [Daily facebook share]<https://click.cssubs.com/?qs=220a9d3cc0d89f9451cb6f7ef8fdb0fca7d1d85c1f4808e1fab58b8406eb11c0755fc1b6070e9775163ec63e5ffc7eb85aaa098666a50245> [Daily twitter share] <https://click.cssubs.com/?qs=220a9d3cc0d89f940d2bc3192faa496f77e10cd2b473188cb09aba2404c3d880efdfc91e3a46af64cd4dcd58ee4239be00d37d0dce1d0bc2>  [Daily email share] <mailto:?subject=I+think+you%27ll+like+this+article+from+the+Monitor+Daily&body=Here's%20the%20article%20on%20CSMonitor.com:+%0A%0A+Why%20El%20Paso%20is%20determined%20not%20to%20roll%20up%20the%20welcome%20mat+%0A%0A+https://www.csmonitor.com/Daily/2019/20190807/Why-El-Paso-is-determined-not-to-roll-up-the-welcome-mat?src=shared+%0A%0A+You%20can%20try%20the%20Monitor%20Daily%20free%20for%20a%20week:%20https://www.csmonitor.com/dailyfreetrial> 2.

This story explains the thinking behind the deeper chess battle between the U.S. and China.  – Mark  The 30 Sec. Read  Fears of a currency war have piled atop anxiety about rising tariffs and their toll on the global economy.  Stock markets around the world swooned after Beijing allowed its currency to fall below a key level against the U.S. dollar. The United States declared China a currency manipulator. Meanwhile, the U.S. and other nations have shifted toward lowering interest rates – a move that can often result in weakening currencies.  But is this a currency war, a modern version of what happened during the Great Depression when nations devalued their currency in a vain attempt to boost their exports at the expense of others?  Many economists are skeptical. The big risk to global economic growth, they say, isn’t currency but tariffs – with the U.S. threats escalating against China last week. And the interest rate cuts can be explained as addressing that risk to overall growth, not as currency manipulation.  Pushing currency values lower can also blunt the impact of tariffs. Battles over currency “are not that bad,” says Olivier Jeanne, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. But as a tool in a rising trade war, it’s worrying.

Or shared interests? The principle guiding President Trump’s “transactional” diplomacy has been more the latter. Among Gulf Arabs, that’s created competition for good U.S. relations.  – Mark  The 30 Sec. Read  President Donald Trump’s about-face on Qatar – receiving the emir, Sheikh Tamim al-Thani, at the White House in July as an “old friend” two years after condemning the Gulf Arab state as a “funder of terrorism” – was telling.  It potentially shifted the balance of power in the Gulf, opening a door to a resurgence of multilateralism in the region. And, say observers and officials there, it exposed the limits of influence achieved by Qatar’s rivals, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, in a transactional White House.  Just as Mr. Trump touted Saudi Arabia’s billions in arms deals during a March 2018 visit by the crown prince, in the recent visit by the emir, Qatar inked tens of billions of dollars in deals with Raytheon, Boeing, and Chevron. It was a case of Qatar beating Saudi Arabia and the UAE at their own game.  Says Andreas Krieg, a lecturer in security studies at King’s College London: “The Qataris understood that Trump is very much a transactional president – as much as the Saudis and the UAE understand – you need to pour money into the country in order to win his favor.”  By Taylor Luck  Read 5 min.<https://www.csmonitor.com/Daily/2019/20190807?cmpid=ema:bundle:20190807&src=email&id=1093695>  ( 1195 words )  [Daily facebook share]<https://click.cssubs.com/?qs=220a9d3cc0d89f948287153b0ff67e427e99fd567f673346538e04c9bcc45e61816e9671356e86136fa42dc80c26e0eb70f0066797ec6480> [Daily twitter share] <https://click.cssubs.com/?qs=220a9d3cc0d89f94ba18cb553ae7d4afd11175ea62f711b31100dc642765f6c9e4d2c966fd4fc3bd4045516005c822c41632e8ddaf143192>  [Daily email share] <mailto:?subject=I+think+you%27ll+like+this+article+from+the+Monitor+Daily&body=Here's%20the%20article%20on%20CSMonitor.com:+%0A%0A+Checkbook%20diplomacy?%20How%20Qatar’s%20renewed%20US%20ties%20reshape%20the%20Gulf.+%0A%0A+https://www.csmonitor.com/Daily/2019/20190807/Checkbook-diplomacy-How-Qatar-s-renewed-US-ties-reshape-the-Gulf?src=shared+%0A%0A+You%20can%20try%20the%20Monitor%20Daily%20free%20for%20a%20week:%20https://www.csmonitor.com/dailyfreetrial> Point of Progress What's going right 4.

Behind their surprise resurgence is renewed emphasis on fostering community.  – Mark  The 30 Sec. Read  In the past decade, the number of independent bookstores in the United States has grown by more than 50%, from 1,651 stores to more than 2,500, according to Dan Cullen, senior strategy officer of the American Booksellers Association.  Observers say a special blend of local flavor, dedication to physical books, accessibility to authors, and a business model that includes other revenue streams has fueled the resurgence. The formula has proved so successful chains are working to bring a small-venue feel to their big-box stores.  “One of the key ingredients to the independent bookseller is this notion of community,” says Ryan Raffaelli, an assistant professor at Harvard Business School. Owners often sit on city boards and are active in public schools, he says.  Patricia Fowler, owner of Village Square Booksellers in Bellows Falls, Vermont, serves as treasurer for two local community groups and participated in a program to support high schoolers as they plan for the future.  “Some of our customers that started out reading picture books are now into the teen and young adult books,” says Ms. Fowler. “We grow with our customers.”  By Thomas Shults  Read 3 min.<https://www.csmonitor.com/Daily/2019/20190807?cmpid=ema:bundle:20190807&src=email&id=1093770>  ( 649 words )  [Daily facebook share]<https://click.cssubs.com/?qs=220a9d3cc0d89f947051f977cf26f6866d69dc21faef93b5d15c6553740d662cc215a774ff82e57ce4921b08a62805a2653b0f3a1e549e2a> [Daily twitter share] <https://click.cssubs.com/?qs=220a9d3cc0d89f94bd51d3537a55593f1d40c9681b68fd600718770a1040c75b73e289a43c1e5efc54509f1e4c2b62e32bf6247bf8aa3230>  [Daily email share] <mailto:?subject=I+think+you%27ll+like+this+article+from+the+Monitor+Daily&body=Here's%20the%20article%20on%20CSMonitor.com:+%0A%0A+Comeback%20story:%20A%20new%20chapter%20for%20indie%20bookstores+%0A%0A+https://www.csmonitor.com/Daily/2019/20190807/Comeback-story-A-new-chapter-for-indie-bookstores?src=shared+%0A%0A+You%20can%20try%20the%20Monitor%20Daily%20free%20for%20a%20week:%20https://www.csmonitor.com/dailyfreetrial> Difference-maker Drivers of change 5.

For one couple, it means they haven’t had the time or money to leave their locale for two years. But it also means a deep connection to animals in need.  – Mark  The 30 Sec. Read  With its wild ’80s-rock-star mane, muscular body, and charismatic nature, the Skyrian horse has become a sort of cultural icon for the Greek island of Skíros. But today, there are fewer than 300 of these horses left worldwide, maybe 200 if counting only purebreds.  Stathis Katsarelias was drawn to the breed and its cultural significance. “I felt this duty because I’m from Skíros,” he says. “As a Skyrian, we should care about them.”  “They will grab your soul and your heart,” says his partner, Amanda Simpson.  In 2005, Ms. Simpson and Mr. Katsarelias started Skyros Island Horse Trust. From the beginning, its mission was twofold: take care of the existing population on Skíros and selectively breed the horse to create a more robust breed. When they started the project, they took in horses from locals who could no longer care for them, as well as some starving horses wandering on the mountainside. They started with four horses. Today, there are 35.  “When I see them here, and I understand that they feel safe, and that they feel secure, and that they are relaxed, this gives me the strength to go on,” says Mr. Katsarelias.

Read  Police are still trying to pin down the exact motives for last weekend’s killings in two American cities. But one motive fits both. Each dehumanized their victims out of rage. Yet not surprisingly, a few of the victims’ families as well as community leaders have refused to reciprocate the rage. They have offered forgiveness.  Acts of forgiveness after a massacre are rare. Yet they can be powerful. In a reminder of what is possible, a documentary came out this spring that details the forgiveness given to Dylan Roof by families of victims killed in 2015 at a black church in Charleston, South Carolina. In the new film “Emanuel,” Chris Singleton, the son of one victim in the church, says his forgiveness was not a choice to “move on.” It took strength to forgive. And it allowed him to be free of anger, to spread love and unity, and to work to prevent similar tragedies.  The impersonal hate of the shooters in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, deserves a response at many levels – justice in the courts, reforms in legislatures, and denunciation of their motives. Yet none may be as powerful to prevent more shootings than forgiveness.

Jammu and Kashmir, India’s only Muslim-majority state, borders Pakistan and has long been disputed. On Tuesday, India’s parliament approved a proposal from the Hindu nationalist-led government to revoke Kashmir's special status, stripping its limited autonomy and raising fears of greater conflict.

But to use an American baseball metaphor, the August 12th Sentinel is a homerun! Geoffry Hibb’s cover article on “The beauty of moderation” is so helpful in pointing out that we can challenge extreme thoughts about exercise, diet, and life/work balance.  I also loved Mark Swinney’s article “Are we independent thinkers?” and the healing he experienced from challenging matter-based thinking. And George Moffett’s article “Taking the time to listen to his voice” was deeply healing and much-needed in these times of constant distractions. It seems that a theme running though every article was about true Spirit-based thinking.  No wonder that Mary Baker Eddy wrote on the very first page of Science and Health, with Key to the Scriptures “The time for thinkers has come.”  Comment Publication *  I give permission to publish my comment.

I am writing to be certain that the subscription is NOT auto-renewed and is cancelled on that date.  I have read the Monitor off and on for several years and finally decided to subscribe.  I had found the reporting, for the most part to be ""fair and balanced"", to borrow the tagline from a news source that  most certainly is not.  I have found though that the tone of the articles in the Monitor have become increasing liberal, even progressive, in their tone and presentation.  Clearly, the many of the writers have viewpoints that is creeping into their writing.  Sometimes it is nuanced, sometimes not.  I think of myself as a Libertarian but, I will admit I lean towards conservatism.  I do though,  try hard to see all sides of a discussion.   I had just finished reading the articles ""Why America's big cities have become the President's punching bag"" and ""Why El Paso is determined not to roll up the welcome mat"".  I found these articles to present a one-sided view with meager attempts to present differing viewpoints.  I found myself sitting here repeating "" but, but""   in my head.  That is when I decided I do not need to subscribe to a publication that writes with a clear bias.  I can find that anywhere without paying for it.  I guess that finding a source that is truly fair and balanced is just  too much to hope in this day and age.  My account information is below.  I would appreciate an acknowledgement that my subscription will be cancelled in October.

Both at our Reading Room and in my work as a chaplain, I've gotten requests from Latinos who want to read about MBE in their native language.   I have also received requests from inmates for a PAPERBACK biography of MBE--as hardback books are generally not allowed in prisons.

On or around 16 March 1971, I attended a dinner by then journalist Sayed Kamaluddin, currently Editor of the Bangladesh weekly The Holiday ( weeklyholiday.net), at which your Saigon correspondent, temporarily reassigned to Dacca, was present. He was Caucasian, mid-30s, well-built, around 6 feet. He made some very interesting observations about the firepower of automatic weapons, based on his VN experience.  3. I can' recall his name. My query: can you tell me his name? if he's still alive? and how can I contact him (email and/or phone no).  4. He must have filed despatches from Dacca in March 1971.

"208","5000g000028bd6UAAQ","Security & Parking Complaint","Hello  I would like to file a complaint regarding a parking and security for the Christian Science Plaza.  iI purchased the spot via SpotHero and was put in an unsafe position because of gross lack of communication between your organization, the Pilgrim Parking Company,  and the Spothero. Spothero Rental ID 24648163  At around 12:20 am on 8/10 I returned to the plaza to get my car. I approached a clearly indicated pedestrian entrance to find a locked gate. I then walked around the building to approach two other entrances which were both locked. One entrance had a call box which I attempted to use with no response. I proceeded to walk around the building again to seek out other entrances or security and found no options. I returned to the call box to try to contact staff. Eventually, the door by the call box unlocked. All that indicated this was a small ""click"" for the door and a small light flashed on a badge access box. There was no verbal communication from staff as a return to my multiple attempts of contact. I managed to return to my car and exited the facility.  As a whole, this was an incredibly unsafe and distressing experience that needs to be addressed by the parking company, site, and Spothero. I cannot be promised a safe and accessible parking facility to be met with locked doors no staff response. As this happened at night I was terrified of not having access to my means of transportation standing stranded outside of a locked building.  SpotHero Complaints: SpotHero indicated that my ticket purchase was for a 24/7 accessible site, with listed amenities including staff on site. The instructions for using the facility gave no explanation for entering or exiting the facilities, which would lead me to trust that I can easily enter without major concerns.  When I got home I checked the Christian Science website which states, ""Currently during construction, parking in the Christian Science Plaza garage is restricted to Church Service attendees and those holding monthly passes. Paid public parking garages are also available in the Prudential Center and on Westland Avenue (near Symphony Hall), and there is limited street parking in the area.Free 3-hour bus parking is available on Huntington Avenue, Westbound, adjacent to the Christian Science Plaza. Drop off at Library entrance.""  None of this information is listed on the Pilgrim Parking website or on SpotHero. This is unacceptable.  Facility complaints are as follows: Poor signage that indicated pedestrian entrance but no information for open/closures. Web information insufficiently distributed to related organizations. Poor staff response onsite to locked doors and call boxes. Severe communication issues with SpotHero that incorrectly list the parking accessibility.  I am contacting the SpotHero and parking company directly to file my complaint as well.  Please email or call to discuss your options in remedying this situation.

"214","5000g000028bAXpAAM","Re: After mass shootings, Republicans wrestle with politics of race","Why is it that the WSJ this morning in an editorial, cited the backgrounds of both shooters, while the CSM only comments on the El Paso shooter’s right wing rants, while making no comment re the Dayton shooter’s “leftist ravings”? And I believe the CSM went to press considerably later than the print edition of the WSJ. I agree with the WSJ comment that “it is disheartening to see how quickly the issue of these two highly disturbed shooters was overwhelmed by the urge to assign political causation”.  I found it discouraging to again see the CSM not really presenting an even-handed analysis of a situation that needs it.

Her novels lyrically and unflinchingly plumbed slavery, sisterhood, racism, justice, sexual abuse, rage, guilt, and liberty. She’s “a national treasure <https://www.facebook.com/barackobama/photos/a.10155401589571749/10156901908101749/?type=3&theater> ... ,” wrote former President Barack Obama today, “a challenge to our conscience and a call to greater empathy.” > She leaves an indelible mark on America <https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/2019/0806/Author-Toni-Morrison-remembered-for-her-visionary-force> and a generation of black writers. I asked Monitor culture critic Candace McDuffie what Ms. Morrison means to her.  > “Toni Morrison made me feel valued and seen in a genre where we are usually neglected,” writes Candace in an email. “In white American literature, black women are either completely ignored or reduced to racist tropes. We are not docile Mammys, nor are we hypersexual Jezebels or inexplicably angry Sapphires. We are multidimensional and beautiful beings whose experiences run deep. Morrison managed to embody our complexities through works that showcased our humanity and wholeness.” > Candace respects that Ms. Morrison “never jeopardized her artistic integrity. ... Topics like slavery and racism and colorism and black feminism dominated her works and were powerful and revelatory because Morrison prioritized black authenticity over white comfort. And because of this, she will always be one of the most important writers of our time.” > Ms. Morrison will be missed. But her unique expression of dignity, defiance, and cultural honesty endures.

Read > As the nation grapples with the aftermath of two horrific mass shootings – one allegedly committed by an avowed white supremacist – the Republican Party has been engaging in a kind of soul-searching of its own.   > Many leading Republican politicians, including several from states with large Latino populations, have made a point of calling out “white supremacy” by name and urging others in their party to take an unequivocal stance. > Other top Republicans haven’t joined the chorus, however, instead blaming mental illness and video games for the actions of mass shooters. And while some in the party see an urgent need to take a strong moral stand, others see a political trap – since many Democrats are arguing that it is hypocritical for any Republican to denounce white supremacy unless he or she also denounces President Donald Trump. > Still, the shift in thought is significant, observers say. Fighting white supremacy will require leaders from both sides of the aisle to consistently and specifically condemn it wherever it emerges, says Cynthia Miller-Idriss, an American University professor who studies far-right youth extremism.  > “I do think this is a genuine shift happening,” Ms. Miller-Idriss says. “We’re seeing a much stronger condemnation now than we have in the past.” > By Jessica Mendoza > By Linda Feldmann > Read 5 min. <https://www.csmonitor.com/Daily/2019/20190806?cmpid=ema:bundle:20190806&src=email&id=1093663> > ( 1201 words ) >  <https://click.cssubs.com/?qs=9837885a621ff901b5503391d76d984d1a66f06a5b0a72eccdb6276f55ffcc3f17532e345ab1546cfd42a7f7aa0f98d7dcab06e2291347be>  <https://click.cssubs.com/?qs=9837885a621ff90134619921283295ba0fc8884865fbe45c3ee694f65c116919cab5abd2d99ea192746c4105ae5264e2919c93ddd3bf9b84>  <mailto:?subject=I+think+you%27ll+like+this+article+from+the+Monitor+Daily&body=Here's%20the%20article%20on%20CSMonitor.com:+%0A%0A+After%20mass%20shootings,%20Republicans%20wrestle%20with%20politics%20of%20race+%0A%0A+https://www.csmonitor.com/Daily/2019/20190806/After-mass-shootings-Republicans-wrestle-with-politics-of-race?src=shared+%0A%0A+You%20can%20try%20the%20Monitor%20Daily%20free%20for%20a%20week:%20https://www.csmonitor.com/dailyfreetrial> > 2.

Our reporter looks at their response.  > – David > The 30 Sec. Read > Thirty-five years ago, Sven Stroosma was a University of Washington student looking for a summer job. He wound up salmon fishing – and fell in love with the business. > Today, Mr. Stroosma and his deckhands – two sons, a nephew, and a friend – fish the blue waters of the Gulf of Alaska, using a net that hangs 100 feet deep. It’s dangerous and demanding work. Amid a U.S.-China trade war, which includes Chinese tariffs on Alaskan seafood, it’s tough financially, too. Last year, Mr. Stroosma says, chum salmon brought in 90 cents per pound. Now, it’s only 50.  > Washington state is the most trade-dependent state in the country, with about 40% of all jobs linked to international commerce; Alaska and Oregon are also among the most affected states. Meanwhile, the trade war seems to have no end in sight. President Donald Trump announced a 10% tariff on another $300 billion of Chinese imports last week.  > So what do you do when you’re caught in the middle? Pacific Northwest lawmakers have lobbied the administration to provide relief for the fishing industry, as it has for farmers.

Read > For decades, Sierra Leone has recorded high levels of sexual violence. And to many women fighting to change that, their battle felt like an invisible one – until this winter. > Anger finally burst into the open as high-profile cases piled up, particularly against children. Soon, President Julius Maada Bio took the unprecedented step of declaring sexual violence a national emergency, and urged half a dozen reforms. “My government will ensure that men who rape have no place in society and will be jailed forever,” he declared, “so that a single rape becomes the last rape.” > But since then, activists’ initial elation has turned to frustration. Lawmakers have rescinded the national emergency. And advocates say there’s been little in the way of real resources or change. > It’s a setback, for sure. But what Sierra Leone’s experience also underscores is where the most important work against gender-based violence needs to happen: at home, in schools, in neighborhoods.

He also says he’s successfully banished gulls from whole lakes, shopping malls, and a nuclear power plant, among other places. > Gulls are renowned for their aerial acrobatics, brazen beach food heists, and shrill squawks. They also have a knack for causing collateral damage when they’re hungry. > Some of the birds peck through the shells of clams, oysters, or mussels, but that’s hard work. So instead, they hoist their prey aloft. And let go. > “Gulls are very creative and they have, over time, learned to drop mollusks on hard surfaces,” says Wayne Petersen, a director at Mass Audubon. “Young gulls see other gulls doing this, and they try it and say, ‘This works.’” > Tracie Cote, principal of the middle school in Wareham, Massachusetts, is all too familiar with this behavior. “They love to drop the shells on our roof,” she says. “We get holes.” > By Doug Struck > Read 5 min. <https://www.csmonitor.com/Daily/2019/20190806?cmpid=ema:bundle:20190806&src=email&id=1093667> > ( 1082 words ) >  <https://click.cssubs.com/?qs=9837885a621ff9015d0cf7555c9d806d5789a30e2f66c21a9d92b58361c33b93fbfb0537a947f65ad74cb6edd8518f777ba2fd0a3502ef32>  <https://click.cssubs.com/?qs=9837885a621ff90101482b9f10c21a32dd922f7738b1fbccf033bd7f8329bc6293ccb9dbdd85275c704f8669f750bc1e726a08a66357a478>  <mailto:?subject=I+think+you%27ll+like+this+article+from+the+Monitor+Daily&body=Here's%20the%20article%20on%20CSMonitor.com:+%0A%0A+Dinged%20cars%20and%20damaged%20roofs:%20The%20high%20cost%20of%20a%20gull%E2%80%99s%20meal+%0A%0A+https://www.csmonitor.com/Daily/2019/20190806/Dinged-cars-and-damaged-roofs-The-high-cost-of-a-gull-s-meal?src=shared+%0A%0A+You%20can%20try%20the%20Monitor%20Daily%20free%20for%20a%20week:%20https://www.csmonitor.com/dailyfreetrial> > 5.

Now, a French inventor has an innovative approach that could be a battlefield tool.   > – David > The 30 Sec. Read > On Sunday, standing atop a small platform fitted with five jet engines, inventor Franky Zapata took 20 minutes to cross the English Channel from Sangatte, France, to Kent, England. But while his device, the Flyboard Air, may appear the stuff of science fiction, it is the French military that hopes he will make it a viable reality. > The French Army, which has funded Mr. Zapata to the tune of $1.5 million, say the hoverboard could one day be a battlefield trump card. French special forces are working closely with Mr. Zapata, a former jet-ski world champion, to fine-tune his machine. “Innovation is not a gimmick,” said Defense Minister Florence Parly of the hoverboard, which she suggested could function as “a flying logistics platform, or an assault platform,” conjuring an image of squadrons of individually airborne infantry descending on an enemy. > But that will take time. “That’s because [the Flyboard] has limited autonomy, it is hardly inconspicuous, and it is difficult to fly,” says Marion Laguës, spokeswoman for the French Defense Innovation Agency. “It is the development prospects that are interesting.” > By Peter Ford > @peterfordcsm <https://twitter.com/peterfordcsm?cmpid=ema:bundle:20190806&src=email> > Read 3 min. <https://www.csmonitor.com/Daily/2019/20190806?cmpid=ema:bundle:20190806&src=email&id=1093674> > ( 608 words ) >  <https://click.cssubs.com/?qs=9837885a621ff901ca3886ae77783fc284448bbcd76cbe040a919e87c84fa7e4648d7fe5cbfc905c30d8167848b8ba841d30cff700522928>  <https://click.cssubs.com/?qs=9837885a621ff901e19df76f877d68a3e0b321623d8b3f6165dd540ea2bb11c9c48f470deaadca3cb6678922547b3c4e4f4a00512a67d0e4>  <mailto:?subject=I+think+you%27ll+like+this+article+from+the+Monitor+Daily&body=Here's%20the%20article%20on%20CSMonitor.com:+%0A%0A+Not%20just%20a%20toy:%20Channel-hopping%20hoverboard%20draws%20military%E2%80%99s%20eye+%0A%0A+https://www.csmonitor.com/Daily/2019/20190806/Not-just-a-toy-Channel-hopping-hoverboard-draws-military-s-eye?src=shared+%0A%0A+You%20can%20try%20the%20Monitor%20Daily%20free%20for%20a%20week:%20https://www.csmonitor.com/dailyfreetrial> > THE MONITOR'S VIEW > The latest lesson in how to end a conflict > The 30 Sec. Read > Mozambique has been home to one of the world’s longest-lasting rebel conflicts. On Tuesday, however, the southern African nation claimed a much better distinction. A final peace pact was signed, but one that differs sharply from similar agreements in other war-torn places: Key elements of the accord were already in the works before the signing. > International mediators had applied a key lesson from attempts to end other world conflicts: Good-faith intentions about a cease-fire, forgiveness of past atrocities, or national reconciliation must first be made concrete by actions. > Mozambique still faces issues in how to reintegrate the former rebels. It also has a small Islamist insurgency in the north. But with foreign help, it has so far applied the lessons of peacemaking and defied a destiny of endless conflict. > By the Monitor's Editorial Board > Read 1 min. <https://www.csmonitor.com/Daily/2019/20190806?cmpid=ema:bundle:20190806&src=email&id=1093669> > ( 337 words ) >  <https://click.cssubs.com/?qs=9837885a621ff901cb2163e24264080302a943e2b361503cd5cd26dbb327693b540ffdef72f6f85c86ba9fe441bb1a4a6e27e54a755fa4d5>  <https://click.cssubs.com/?qs=9837885a621ff901938379d41d4f6b121616d44669ea71acfba531563750ef22cb63ebbe91526ac48f68bf6bf1def046d9a84241d38dc815>  <mailto:?subject=I+think+you%27ll+like+this+article+from+the+Monitor+Daily&body=Here's%20the%20article%20on%20CSMonitor.com:+%0A%0A+The%20latest%20lesson%20in%20how%20to%20end%20a%20conflict+%0A%0A+https://www.csmonitor.com/Daily/2019/20190806/The-latest-lesson-in-how-to-end-a-conflict?src=shared+%0A%0A+You%20can%20try%20the%20Monitor%20Daily%20free%20for%20a%20week:%20https://www.csmonitor.com/dailyfreetrial> > A CHRISTIAN SCIENCE PERSPECTIVE > ( About this feature <https://click.cssubs.com/?qs=9837885a621ff901a79db0e62b7a591c70ca8134c11b8061e005ae0814233e2dc17643f54885add3ce011143cb98805fb5b1d399cadaaac5> ) > Protection during attack > It’s possible to know God as an active, protecting presence in our lives, as one young man experienced when attacked by a stranger on a city street. > By Peter J.

This semester I’m teaching a Current Issues course and I would like the students to focus primarily on articles from The Christian Science Monitor. I notice that the students would only be able to access 3 articles unless they have a digital subscription. I’m wondering if there are reduced rates or free subscriptions for students? I have less than 10 students in the class and it is only one semester, so the access would be for September-November. My hope would be that the deep dive into news through the CS Monitor would encourage them to be subscribers on their own in the future. Thank you for letting me know the subscription options for the CS Monitor use in class.

On that note,  I like to read early editions of the Journal, especially the testimonies, to learn how people initially heard about CS. Many women testifiers in the 1890's mentioned hearing about these (alleged)  painless childbirths and naturally wanted to investigate. You might find the  testimony of Mary Simpson from 1912 interesting as her birth experience closely resembles your own. https://journal.christianscience.com/issues/1912/12/30-9/twenty-years-ago-by-a-strange Susan Self  Comment Publication *  I give permission to publish my comment.

Product: Monitor Daily  Message: While mourning this weekend’s mass shootings (and all the ones before that make me fear this is a new normal) I read Chapter 20 in Bill Bryson’s book “One Summer: America, 1927” and was surprised to learn our country has experienced random mass killings before (bombings, in that era). The silver lining to me is that they stopped at some point. Which made me realize that we can see a cessation of these mass killings in our generation too. I am curious at what stopped the mass killings then so they were no longer considered inevitable and if there are lessons for us today. Thought that kind of research and perspective is your type of journalism. Thanks so much for the thoughtful way you cover even the tough news!","CSM","CSX","Editorial"
